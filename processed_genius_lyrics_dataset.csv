An Overdose of Fun,rock,Liver Killer,2016,24,{},"Wake up! To the real world
A fucked up place twisted and curled
Where you'll have to slave yourself
Your father, your mother, your children as well


And the day you die
The bank won't cry
Smiling straight away
Tells your family to pay

Your life would be a waste
Your memory is erased
In debt for all time
It's so sad I can't even rhyme


So fuck it! Get off your chair
You don't have more time to spare
Fuck 'em all! Search for new ways
Time for long term holidays

Travel around the world
Drink and fuck 'em all
Lay and just relax
Let grass grow on your back

Be yourself for once
Dance and fucking bounce
An overdose of fun
Never killed anyone


Wake up! You are free
Just live as you please
A blue sky is all you need
Just as the sand beneath your feet

Partying in the bay

A paradise for you

Blown Away,rap,Saigon,2012,941,{},"[Verse 1]
Martin Luther King had more than a dream
He was out for social change and that sort of a thing
Tried to lead us to freedom, but before it would ring
He got blown away
He seen the problem and thought that he had to answer prolly
And that's the reason Huey started the Panther party
Wasn't for Hoover he'd be alive today
Bang, he got blown away
That man Clarence Smith was like a father to many
Was for the love cause the brother wasn't offered a penny
He said the black man was God and it costed him plenty
Was at the time when wasn't no police officers friendly
He birthed the five percent nation, call him the true and living
And just for that you know they whooped him and threw him in prison
Wasn't for them then he'd be with us today
Bang, he got blown away
Marvin Gaye wrote a song called ''What's Going On?''
The label said no, but he convinced them to go along
He spoke of Vietnam and the shit that was going wrong
Trying to convince people that they need to keep holding on
He sang ''Mercy Mercy Me'', it felt like he was crying
He want to save the hood, they understood why he was trying
He took a stand and said what he had to say
Bang, he got blown away
2Pac Shakur was more than a rapper, more than an actor
It was more than awards he was after
He tried to teach young, black people a better way
He got blown away
Hey, we gotta give it to him, Abraham Lincoln was honest
He was a racist, but he did what he said when he promised
He freed slaves, of course he was gonna pay
He got blown away
John F. Kennedy fought for the people
A white president, that wanted to see all of us equal
At least that was what he said when running for office to be to
But then he won and started doing more for the people
Assassin hit him with a bullet that tore his cerebral
I know a lot of y'all thinking ''we wanna believe you''
Black people prayed for JFK
But bang, he got blown away
Same way, Gosh, I can't forget Peter Tosh
If Bob Marley was Jigga then Tosh would be Nas
Peter was Bob right hand man, one hand washed
All of these brothers wanted more than to just to be large
Killer on the guitar, but better up on the mic
Y'all remember the revolutionary shit that he would write?
Like ""get up, stand up, stand up for your right""
Bang, he got blown away
You damn right
Martin Luther King had more than a dream
He was out for social change and that sort of a thing

He tried to teach young, black people a better way

His Love Was Reaching,pop,David Meece,2015,115,{},"Where should I begin to tell my thoughts

To show my gratitude

Though the times I was burdened
Yet I did not fall
Though the times I was certain
There was no one at all

His love was reaching
An invisible hand pulling me through
His love was reaching
Touching my life in more ways than I ever knew

As I lay beneath the southern cross
The stars tell more than I could
And if the words don't say want I really mean
I pray I'm understood

When I thought I had nothing
Yet I had so much
Though the years when it seemed
We were out of touch
His love was reaching
An invisible hand pulling me through
Touching my life in more ways than I ever knew

How could I think I was living alone
How could a man be so blind
How could I have come so far

Lethargos,rock,Scarletborn,2017,22,{},"Good morning, New Age
This is a welcome speech
Not like the ones you always hear
You abandoned yourselves, you betrayed all your struggles, in the name of lethargy and sloth

And while you are on your own
You forgot to awaken
You forgot to embrace the knowledge of the world
Wake up you fools
Stand up from your coaches submissive and idle and impolite frauds
Breath like you mean it, let those lungs live for a while

Stop staring your devices for those so called eyes will pop out
But then you lay on your chair until comfort takes your breath
Gazing at screens of yonder realms

And you forgot who you are
You forgot how to breathe
You forgot to salvage the knowledge of the world
Wake up you fools
Stand up from your coaches submissive and idle and impolite frauds
Or just stare at your device until your so called eyes pop out
Threshold, obedience is on your threshold
I saw Lethargos rise
Behold, the time has come
For you to stand up, or just exhale the air I breathe

“Inhaling causes severe damage to those who can’t afford intelligence or mere knowledge
Well, I kind of feel the urge to punch their noses

It’s not impulse for the sake of impulse
I love everything you say, you are, you do
Ohhh, Ohhh

Turning a house into a home
You know you’re everything I love
There are no words for this
You’re indescribable, I
Wish I could tell you what I want
I hope I’m not being too much
Hope that you feel the same
And I’d do anything
Love you a million different ways
My missing half, what can I say?
Loving you’s easy
The hardest part is saying so

Yeah I'm on the prowl, ice cold like Green Bay
Assaulting this beat like my name was Ray
Rice or Lewis, it don't even matter you're all acting foolish
Cause I been in the studio, DJ by myself
Don't need nobody else, put this mixtape on your shelf
So you can call me an asshole, the fuck if I care-""uh like Staz is sad and says that wasn't fair""
Yeah fuck off bitch, you're just blowing hot air
Now watch out rap game here comes my ceux d'etat
Bro I did your girl, here's her bra
And sorry to hear about her stuck jaw
Did things I think are against the law
We did it in the lazy boy recliner
She wants me to be her new interior designer
But if she wants another date imma decline her
Yeah, you can say I pulled the lever
Cause I did your girl so hard you might have to leave her
Get mad at me cause I didn't holster it
I reupholstered it
And now my flows too wet
But these extra lines on my mixtape bolster it
You mad at me, you better call me prestigious
I banged that Mormon chick you can call it sac-religious

Whoa hold up this shit's immature
Let me start from the beginning, give you B-Stazzy galore
Yes my bars may offend but I don't give a shit
I don't pretend to even care a little bit
I'm gonna go do the things that dudes go
That means beers and booze and boobs
You don't like it then fuck you
Summarize it, my bars are sought after
After this rap ask who's the best, I'll be the one you thought after
If you're cold, listen to this you'll be thawed after
The best rapper ever, you'll say you saw it after
I'm the top pick like my name is Jamis
All my haters out here makin' me famous
But problem... i don't got any haters
I'm the '09 Florida Gators
My flow is nastier then African tap water
And the lyrics are hot like that time I fucked your daughter

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
My Aunt Vi said, ""There's a bit of Christ in all of us"" (Amen)
She also said, ""There's a time that Christ is gon' call on us"" (Pray for us)
I figure 'til that time come, we gon' live life and ball it up
My man said, ""Lemme hold somethin',"" drop it on the floor, ball it up, yeah
Raid came, we flushed so much coke, we clog ya toilet up (Flush)
When grandma died, damn, I had turned to alcoholic, but (I miss you, mama)
Slowly but surely, I found my way back (Facts)
Like that time I lost a key, I had to bounce my way back
I'm talkin' twenty-eight 28's, I had to ounce my way back (What you know 'bout that?)
Shit, ten grams of powder, I made an ounce of straight crack (A lot of baking soda)
I know you probably sayin' thеse war stories are rеpetitious (But they're the truth)
But never forget that my intellect is vicious
I sat on cigarettes in the ocean just to intercept the fishes (Facts)
Love my niggas way too much to go and spend my check on bitches
Melly lifted his shirt and then he showed me his exit stitches (I miss you, nigga)
When you get married to the game, they never give you no wedding pictures (Woo)
So when I'm reflectin' my past, it's only to better your future (You hear that?)
Versace all black and the back, the head of Medusa (Drippin')
I love shoppin' at Saks, but the prices is better with boosters (Woo)
We was up at the crack of dawn, but we ain't hear no echoin' roosters
I make a brick have a baby like the doctor just induced her (Uh-huh)
Shit, it's bad enough on the block with the opps and the cops that'll shoot ya (Boom, boom, boom)
I'm out of breath
I can't breathe like a knee is on my neck

Only stamp the niggas that be actually with us
High off dope, the cameras help me back the Benz up
Thirty thousand dollars in a grocery bag

When they double team you, you supposed to pass
A hundred plates in the rental, I'm on my way to Baltimore
I don't trust these niggas, not one of 'em have I saw before

Mazza did the Audemars

Trapped in the projects, yeah, we all was bored
Lookin' for somethin' that we could all afford

So which motherfuckers wanna test

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I throw your brain in the cobra clutch, behold the rush
A dazzling display if you could get close enough
Cold Crush like the 4 stinger anaconda
Fierce darts that'll pierce through solid armor
Lounge in the barracks with Blue and Cappadonna
Spiderman identity Peter Parker
Crowd pleaser register off the meter
Vocal street sweeper bucks shots through the speaker
Pleasure seekers, 50 thou' in the stands
True fans get it hot like Jamaica sands
Conquer land, wide like a eagle wingspan
Clansman stabbin the track with both hands
Not a lost soul who falls for fool's gold
I shine like a diamond in the true state of cold
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Rap with a road block, I might lose control
Hold the globe in my iron palm
One hand holds the firearm on a mission that's life long
Strike calm through the fire like Chaka Khan
World wide on the web without the dot com
[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
See I always have respect cause I always talk fact
The .38 and the 50 caliber hot, black
I always left with nothing but I always brought back
I always been a hustler, I probably go off that
Y’all don’t wanna go to work with the boy
There’s only two words that describe me: search and destroy
I don’t think you wanna get murked by the boy
My shit is military, y’alls is like a nursery toy
It’s hurting you boys
My team ain’t even hungry, we famished
I murder everybody, fuck collateral damage
I’m animal savage with Hannibal’s habits
I’ll mangle your cabbage
I walked into the parish and I strangled the faggots
I hang with the baddest brothers, put their trust into Jesus
Run with brothers who’s forty guzzlers, Islamic extremists
Ugly and ignorant is how they perceive us
I don’t care, I’m trying to deal with my personal demons

And you deserve a few

But you're my love
So I can never lay a hand on you

Suffocate
Girl, I think we'll suffocate

'We're in love today'
Listen
Fuck you never listen
And she thinks that everything must be golden
If it glistens
And she's wishing
That we're sticking
In the shit that we've created
Funny how the line is thin between true love and hatred
But since the love in us is vacant
I guess it makes no sense to stay then
So I guess the answer is in the leaving
We've been defeated
Never been easy
I can't believe it
Fuck off and leave me
I know you need me
Easy to see we
Never show feelings
And in the evening, she just turns around
Says that I want her as much as my freedom
And that shit ain't fucking helping
I swear it's never helping

I swear I'm Michael Phelpsing

And I can't seem to get you out my head
Cause everytime I try, I get stuck between the lines
And it gets hard for us to fight
I lie, she lie, don't wanna be by
Were so overrated, if you couldn't help to realize
Everything you said, I had a problem, Ill just see by it
Now your only talking just to cause a problem, I said be quiet
Sometimes, I get fed up, and the other time I miss you
And I try, but its difficult to look through all our issues, yeah

This is the end for me and you, breaking up like it's nothing new
I'm glad it's over, The pain is over, our love was overrated

Makeshift Patriot remix,pop,Sage Francis,2015,182,{},"(People talking)
I'm tired of hearing of young fellows, who think you know it all
You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired
And you're waving the damn flag

Frank, what's that man?

I'm just watching some bullshit
On the news. It's fucking bullshit
Reporters trying to win a fucking emmy

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)

It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself for your live telecast
Coming live from my own funeral
Beautiful weather offered a nice shine
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever altered skyline
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence
My journalist ethic slips when I pass them off as objectives
Don't give me that ethical shit
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable american kids
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is
That's exactly how they attacked
When a typically dark-skinned disney villain
Use civillians against civillians and charge the trojan horse into our buildings
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children;
Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions
I had to back-pedal from the shower of glass and metal
Wondering if after it settles
We'll find who provided power to radical rebels
The melting pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over
But only on our own soil
So the little boy holds a toy soldier
And waits for the suit and tie to come home
We won't wait till he's older, though
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end
I'll get a close-up of his head

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)
It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself while the stock markets crash

The city is covered in inches of muck
I see some more pictures of victims are up
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck
Leaping lovers are making descisions to jump while holding hands
To escape the brutal heat;
Sometimes in groups of three
The fallout was far beyond the toxic clouds where people look like debris
But all they say when all was said
Beyond the talking heads
Was the bloody dust with legs
Looking like the walking dead calling for meds
All the hospitals overwhelmed
Volunteers need to go the hell home
Moments of silence for firefighters were interrupted by cell phones
Who's going to make that call, to increase an unknown death toll?
Its the one we rally behind
He's got a megaphone, promising to make heads roll
We'd cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control
The less we know, the more they fabricate
The easier it is to sell souls
(Man talking)
There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last
Changes need to be made;
No more curbside baggage
Seven pm curfew
Racial profiling will continue with less bitching
We've unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote
Remember, our kind is bigger, stronger, smarter, and much wealthier
So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part

We're selling addictive, twenty-four hour candlelight vigils on TV
Freedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties
The viewers are glued to television screens, stuck
'cause lots of things seem too sick
I use opportunities to pluck heartstrings for theme music
I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at
Which foot is right to kiss
We don't really know who the culprit is yet
But he looks like this
We know who the heroes are
They're not the xenophobes who act hard
We taught that dog to squat
How dare he do that shit in our own back yard
They happen to scar our financial state
And char our landscape
Can you count how many times so far I ran back the same damn tape?
While the cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats
On the west bank, with the ten second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst
So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle
'cause even if we win this tug of war and even the score
Humanity struggles
There's a need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble;
Some of them dug for answers in the mess
But the rest were looking for trouble

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)

It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself
Don't waive your rights with your flags

(Two people talking)
Seriously, if I want to find out anything, I'm not going to read Time Magazine
I'm not going to read Newsweek, I'm not going to read any of these magazines
I mean, because they've just got too much to lose by printing the truth
You know that

[Intro]
Jay Trench

[Chorus: Lancey Foux]
GT Turbo
Don't disturbo
I hit the swerveo
Missed the curbo
I keep the burn-up
I check the thermostat it's hot
I check the thermostat it's litty
Niggas know me, I came from the city
I like my tings dark skin, sadiki
Put all type of
Put all type of smoke in the air
Put all type of smoke in the city

[Verse 1: Lancey foux]
I just roll my sleeve, it might get tricky
Get swipe and delete, get swept off
I'm getting right where I left off
I'm getting pyroteched off
I'm getting pyrotеchnical
Kickin' it by a pedigree
Kickin' it by a pedigree
Diesеl bag, smellin' me
Diesel bag, smellin' me
I geek up the 4, let's go
I smoke me a old petrol
I'm on the road, no show
I put 5% on my whip
I do my horror show
I put private lens on my jeep
I ain't gotta' say no more
Tell her bring her friends and that's it
Stash house, starting full
We park the Benz at the crib
[Verse 2: Cadell]
I put my heart where I stick with my circle
Big [?]
I got a pack, not mist and Churchill
Learnt how to hide it, I'm going commercial
I done took charge of so many Germans you would've thought I was Angela Merkel
You woulda' thought I was standing with Özil
Whip it in, after my name is [?]
Look like a mouse, with a [?] in my [?]
Posting up [?]
Liars and scammers and trappers and murderous thieves
Bitch you ain't getting a Birkin from me
Bitch really blow out your big back, please
Returning the favour, she got McD's
Return of the mac, just know I'm back
It hurts to the core that I dig that deep
Always see Roman Road that's my fucking ends that's my shit

Sin Nombre Live in New Jersey,rock,Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers,2009,38,{},"[Spoken]
Salud, everybody
Here's a song without a name

[Verse 1]
Rode hard and put up wet
I ain't down but I can't get up yet
It's a long ride back to the way I want to feel

Sun down across the plain
I've been sore before I'll be sore again
No place to hide to keep from runnin'
Laid down in the cottonwood hollow
I left a trail no man could follow
Is it safe to rest my head again till morning
Cracked throat and my canteen's dry
And rain don't fall from an empty sky
So I'll whisper Hail Marys till the sun comes up

[Chorus]
Now don't tell me that part of the story
When the cowboy falls in love
When he traded in his pistol and his saddle and the stars above
And when the candle's burnin' down
When midnight comes around
You know the best that we can hope for
Is to be laughin'
When we finally hit the ground
[Verse 2]
Rode hard I jumped down tired
Stripped from the saddle when the rifle fired
Deep in dreams of women and clean water
Well I did before what I'll do again
So forgive me Father if I have sinned
But the old wood cracks before it bends

[Chorus]
Now don't tell me that part of the story
When the cowboy falls in love
When he traded in his pistol and his saddle and his stars above
And when the candle's burnin' down
When midnight comes around
You know the best that we can hope for
Is to be laughin'
When we finally hit the ground

[Chorus]
Now don't tell me that part of the story
When the cowboy falls in love
When he traded in his pistol and his saddle and his stars above
But when the candle's burnin' down
When midnight comes around
You know the best that we can hope for
Is to be laughin'
When we finally hit the ground
Yeah the candle's burning down
Now midnight comes around
You know the best that we can hope for
Is to be laughin'
When we finally hit the ground

The candle's burning down

Events make cells grow and divide        (2x)
Events make cells grow and d-d-ivide

In Cell Division (woooh hoo)
Events make cells grow and divide
Events make cells grow and divide      (2x)
Events make cells grow and d-d-ivide

At Interphase
The cell gets big
It makes a copy
Of DNA
The cell is active
Matures in size
Prepares to split
Into two- sides

I know the next stage is called
In Mitosis
It's Prophase
Metaphase that's not all
And Three, Anaphase
And the next Telephase
Then it's Cytokinesis
The cycle is done d-d-d-done
Prophase is one
The nucleus
Chromatin condenses
Making Chromo-somes
Spindle fibers form
A bridge between the
End of the cell
And then the Membrane breaks down

Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it and do it, and do it ,let's live it up. and do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it 'cause

In Cell Division (woooh hoo)
Events make cells grow and divide
Events make cells grow and divide   (2x)
Events make cells grow and d-d-ivide


Metaphase is next (hey) yelled
Chromosomes line up (They will line up)
All in the middle (hey)
And they hold on (they will hold on)
The spindle fibers (fibers)
At it's centromeres (the centromeres)
Which still is holding (c'mon)
Chromatids joined
Anaphase is up (three)
It's time to split (go 'way)
Centromeres breaking (move it, move it)
They separ-rate

The chromatids (chromatids)
It moves along (moves along)
The spindle fibers (wooohooo)
Opposite ends of the cell

Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it and do it, and do it let's live it up. And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it do it, do it, do it


Telaphase
Chromosomes
Begin to stretch out, out, out, out, out
They don't look like they did
No more like rods, rods, rods, rods, rods
This occurs
At the ends
Of the new cells, cells, cells, cells, cells

Nuclear
Membranes form
Around each part, part, part, part, part
Mitosis, Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase, Cytokinesis

Cell membrane go-goes around
The middle of the cell-cell
Pinches into two
A d-d-daughter cell's the same

[ Verse 3 ]
(Was it on Friday...)
I think it was on Friday
I felt kinda wild hey
I heard her say “bye Bae”
In a sly way
I was hoping she might stay
It was chaai hey
She did say she loves me
But doesn’t know if I’m where love or lust be
She does crave to fuck me
Coz she doesn’t want an L if she tries to Trust me
You know the love we shared
Is greater than the deed that we do in bed
There’s a passage I read
Don’t give up on that happiness quest you led
So I called her and said
I’m craving wings and you
So pull up in a few
And I’ll order for two
So you can swallow my D
While we’re waiting on Mr D
And don’t you ever go taint out history
Coz it’s been nothing but love , no misery
I kinda figured she
Took the liberty
To go out with me persistently
Coz her friends gave her advice that was sisterly
They insisted she
Take our separation as a victory
Coz I was bound to screw her over like the system be
My playa run been running consistently
And nothin go stop me even blistered feet
I’m done with Miss Murphy along with Miss Murray
I’ll cut all ties with my girl , Miss Shirley
I’m tryna clean my sheet my rep’s been dirty
“We’re not done yet , Listen to M”
Big M - Listen to M




Verse 1 : Big M
0:05
I ran into Wes Morlan
In Portland Oregon
Tryna deport your organ
In a fort
To store it in
And Ofcourse I’m pouring
In foreign porcelain
In assorted ordinance
Towards subordinate coordinates
Where that imported fortune is
I hit up Villaino and said , “Ey yow Cuz I have a lot on my chest
So cook a beat for me , M wants to vent
And not about the rules that I bent
I’m addressing the ville coz it’s a loophole fest”
First off , fuck episodes of girls go missing
When we split between , trafficking or she went bitching
But come back home after a post we’re pitching
Shiit , thats where we sense a glitch in
Before you get amused by sucking dick in the kitchen
Just think about your family who are stressing and wishin
That you come back home , Coz your roam is on loan
And I’m not prone to condone those  ruggidy roams
What you doing is dangerous , it’s gotta be sacked
Coz Igo and Nibo might get you napped
But we’ll assume you’re fine , and this is all an act
Coz you played us before and yes that’s a fact
But Those help find  , I won’t stop sharing
Coz M got sisters so I can’t stop caring
That’s the shiit I’m bearing
But I can’t zip my lip and continue starring
Or Fold G
I put that on Goldie
Dude cracks me up but not like his posts b
Goldie quoting Goldie , That’s like M referencing M
That shiit doesn’t make your craft a gem
I laughed so hard when I saw you with Street Soul
He’s old
Never reaching his peak goal
He knows
I’m gotta knock him out like D Bow
You been rapping for 12 years but can’t score a Free show
Shouts out to the Chronicles , Thintwa and Cazz
Chro , Pro with their feet on the gas
The produkts , Villaino , Stuchie and Els
And ous Mami Deep I want you on my lap
Lets do date nights on late nights , let’s just take flight
Smooch all day , I’m inlove with your ass
So Hit a nigga up , I swear I won’t pass
I just want you to ride with me before I go crash
Me and Xavier Ndima are grinding heirs
We’re here for the Fe(fee) , you know Iron pairs
Y’all follow a trend , you know  “Simon says”
With those violent dares comes silent tears
Now I know who got me and who don’t really got me
But I couldn’t careless coz I’m still go pop G
I don’t got the recipe don’t get me wrong
But you coulda gave me my song like you did with Don
We go way back but You still did me wrong
I love you G Shaun
All The Who’s who’s in the ville Are in cahoots with The Who’s who
And you looking unfamiliar my niggas , who’s you
Sippin on Chivas
Stacking those figures
While Wolf disses niggas but won’t say who’s “niggas”
You’re scared to shoot but your fingers on those triggers
I don’t get understand y’all niggas

Whos That?,rap,Jesse Abraham,2011,28,{},"[Verse 1]
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Mr. Hartman
I'm just an artist
Just gettin started
Just a part of the planet
My plan is to chart all the progress
I'm just being honest
I got a fondness for smarts
It's the hardest growth to achieve but I believe in the harvest
But what I don't perceive is a market
I'm no Magellan, no sailin', no targets
I'm no Delano
Hell no
Pardon my hardened slice on the mice up in the garden
I'm carvin' a new niche
""My, aren't you kitsch?""
Nah, I'm just parked in the margin
I've just landed like Marvin the Martian
I'm markin my territory
I'm the sergeant
Leading this army of varmints that aren't regarded as ardent
But pardon, we're starving
[Chorus]
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside

[Verse 2]
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Abraham
But next time I'm asked yo I'll just say ""a man""
Understand what I am is a plan devised by creation's hands
I'm taking a stand
And demanding when changing from ape into man that we raise as a clan
Remain as a family
And can it be we raise our hands when the shit hits the fan?
Stand the beneath the canopies
And if we ever gave a damn we'd be saved from the bland
Expand from the waves to the land
I'm breakin the strand full of faking with brands
And behaving like laymen with our brains in our hands
I'm everything I say that I am
Now I'm aching to wake up and shake up the sand
That is falling from the hourglass
Every time a hour passes by I'm asking why we're still taking exams
The test is over
[Chorus]
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside

[Verse 3]
Who's that knockin' on my door?
My name is Jesse
I'm not here to teach you so why you wanna test me?
Yeah this could get messy
So let's be balanced and not get dizzy like Gillespie
I'm just an MC
Sweet like a Nestle treat or a Pepsi
But still I am the
One who is here to steer whoever's empty
And fill them with care the dare is so tempting
I'm just attempting to be inventing
I believe in ending the pretending
I've achieved and seen a relenting spirit and I hear it every time I rhyme
Blending the answers with questions
My candor is senseless
I'm bursting and quenching your thirst with my venting
And I'm sending a vocal message
And I am not texting
I'm not texting
[Chorus]
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get in-side
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get in-side
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get in- side

Stand Your Ground,country,Cassandra Vasik,1993,10,{},"We used to spend your round on a Saturday Night
You thought you were on fire
You thought you were in love
When he held you tight
So you gave in to desire

Now that you need him
Where did he go
The pain inside will start to show
You can't tell him what he needs to know

When it all comes down you got to
Stand your Ground
Dig a little deeper when it comes down
To scared to pray
To brave to drown
Help is on the way
Baby, stand your ground

Now the morning light
Will make her weep
Promises were spoken
Finally cries herself to sleep
The spirit can't be broken
This ol' world is a cold cold place
You lose faith in the human race
Listen to your heart
It's your saving grace

When it all comes down you got to
Stand your Ground
Dig a little deeper when it comes down
To scared to pray
To brave to drown
Help is on the way
Baby, stand your ground

Where's that magic wishing well
Tried to hide behind
Where's your friends who
Love you
He's gone and robbed you blind

When it all comes down you got to
Stand your Ground
Dig a little deeper when it comes down

Clique Bait,rock,Pine Barons,2020,42,{},"Vivid dreams of recurring scenes I can't believe
The final breath of your galaxy
Colorful death and grand prismatic oceans boiling
Vibrant symbols flashing in the night sky
Sucked into the wormhole
So magnificent and horrifying
I'm not made of sand, after all
On and off, the lisping voice
It comes and goes -
My worthy adversary

Sleep tight, pariah, it's alright
Pirouetting on a tight wire
Tempting to taste belladonna
Grace me with passionate fire

Testing out my own advice
So haunting to be wrong
Like drifting in space

(when you say)
I give up, I don't want it anymore
Need to let it go
Need to make bеlieve
Need to let it go
Need to lеt it go

Sleep tight, pariah, it's alright
Pirouetting on a tight wire
Tempting to taste belladonna
Grace me with passionate fire

Starling mirage on the meadow
I don't even know what it means
Stage-fright messiah won't let go
And I don't want them to see me

Twitching shadows in the candlelight

I will rise to the top, of the pile myself

Cause they shoot for the stars and refuse, to lose!

That I care if I lose, I'm a winner so I move with a vision
Never fool with the timid, rather learn so I listen

Too vicious for you who step into the trenches
Raw, talent - never back down

Full steam ahead for the cake, for the bread 'til I'm fed

A Sea-side Walk,misc,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,2013,15,{},"I.

       &nbsp       &nbspWe walked beside the sea
After a day which perished silently
Of its own glory—like the princess weird
Who, combating the Genius, scorched and seared,
Uttered with burning breath, ""Ho! victory!""
And sank adown, a heap of ashes pale:
       &nbsp       &nbspSo runs the Arab tale.

II.

       &nbsp       &nbspThe sky above us showed
A universal and unmoving cloud
On which the cliffs permitted us to see
Only the outline of their majesty,
As master-minds when gazed at by the crowd:
And shining with a gloom, the water grey
       &nbsp       &nbspSwang in its moon-taught way.

III.
       &nbsp       &nbspNor moon, nor stars were out;
They did not dare to tread so soon about,
Though trembling, in the footsteps of the sun:
The light was neither night's nor day's, but one
Which, life-like, had a beauty in its doubt,
And silence's impassioned breathings round
       &nbsp       &nbspSeemed wandering into sound.

IV.

       &nbsp       &nbspO solemn-beating heart
Of nature! I have knowledge that thou art
Bound unto man's by cords he cannot sever;
And, what time they are slackened by him ever,
So to attest his own supernal part,
Still runneth thy vibration fast and strong
       &nbsp       &nbspThe slackened cord along:

V.

       &nbsp       &nbspFor though we never spoke
Of the grey water and the shaded rock,
Dark wave and stone unconsciously were fused
Into the plaintive speaking that we used
Of absent friends and memories unforsook;
And, had we seen each other's face, we had
       &nbsp       &nbspSeen haply each was sad.",169532,en,en,en,i nbsp nbspwe walked beside the sea after a day which perished silently of its own glorylike the princess weird who combating the genius scorched and seared uttered with burning breath ho victory and sank adown a heap of ashes pale nbsp nbspso runs the arab tale ii nbsp nbspthe sky above us showed a universal and unmoving cloud on which the cliffs permitted us to see only the outline of their majesty as masterminds when gazed at by the crowd and shining with a gloom the water grey nbsp nbspswang in its moontaught way iii nbsp nbspnor moon nor stars were out they did not dare to tread so soon about though trembling in the footsteps of the sun the light was neither nights nor days but one which lifelike had a beauty in its doubt and silences impassioned breathings round nbsp nbspseemed wandering into sound iv nbsp nbspo solemnbeating heart of nature i have knowledge that thou art bound unto mans by cords he cannot sever and what time they are slackened by him ever so to attest his own supernal part still runneth thy vibration fast and strong nbsp nbspthe slackened cord along v nbsp nbspfor though we never spoke of the grey water and the shaded rock dark wave and stone unconsciously were fused into the plaintive speaking that we used of absent friends and memories unforsook and had we seen each others face we had nbsp nbspseen haply each was sad,nbsp nbspwe walked beside sea day perished silently glorylike princess weird combating genius scorched seared uttered burning breath ho victory sank adown heap ashes pale nbsp nbspso runs arab tale ii nbsp nbspthe sky us showed universal unmoving cloud cliffs permitted us see outline majesty masterminds gazed crowd shining gloom water grey nbsp nbspswang moontaught way iii nbsp nbspnor moon stars dare tread soon though trembling footsteps sun light neither nights days one lifelike beauty doubt silences impassioned breathings round nbsp nbspseemed wandering sound iv nbsp nbspo solemnbeating heart nature knowledge thou art bound unto mans cords sever time slackened ever attest supernal part still runneth thy vibration fast strong nbsp nbspthe slackened cord along v nbsp nbspfor though never spoke grey water shaded rock dark wave stone unconsciously fused plaintive speaking used absent friends memories unforsook seen others face nbsp nbspseen haply sad,Neutral,-0.003999999999999996,0.42977777777777776
Dead Extras,rock,Dead Extras,2017,23,{},"[First Verse]
Sink me with all lost souls, the treachery of youth burning cold
Pushing past all past regrets, trauma from a time that you’ll never forget
When everything you’ve done and everyone you’ve met, can’t claw you back from the land of the dead
Make the trade, you know how it goes, every hero haunts their habits of old

[Chorus]
My mind sees fake spectres, eternal ethereal, dead extras
All eyes fix on the centre, the shadows in the waiting wings, dead extras

[Second Verse]
Every path ends up the same, ground into the dirt or caught in the flame
Purified in the nuclear age, the sunken cities all swept away
Keep your eulogies, keep your conscience clean, tie your tongue with infinity
Seduced by the silver screen, illusory immortality

[Pre-Chorus]
Drowned beneath the waves, drowned beneath the page, I won’t be a casualty of a cruel age
Drowned beneath the waves, drowned beneath the page, I won’t be a victim of the centre stage

[Chorus]
My mind sees fake spectres, eternal ethereal, dead extras
All eyes fix on the centre, the shadows in the waiting wings, dead extras
[Bridge]
And the hospital, becomes the final call for us all, plastic tags to hold our names, lost in lists, caught on the page
Everyone an actor, every part all played, audition for eternity, jostling for centre stage, as
The blood that birthed me, the dynasty in my DNA, in a far flung field of the cemetery fades under unassuming graves
Every orphaned author’s obscene dream, what’s forgotten about you, forgotten about me, what’s written out of the obituaries?

All eyes fix on the centre, the shadows in the waiting wings, dead extras

Still waiting by the phone

Just not over it
I still think that you'll come back home

At night when I lay in my bed
Next to the spot where you once lived
I sometimes reach my arm across
The empty indentation, a ghost of a sensation, and all my imagination
Can't make this feel real again

I don't get much sleep
I just don't see the need
My dreams don't comfort me
When I close my eyes to sleep
You are all I see

I can't used to this
I'm still waiting by the phone

I'm just not over it

Can't make this feel like it did before you left me

When you left here with the best me

Mad Mew Mew WITH LYRICS - Undertale Cover,pop,Juno Songs,2020,86,{},"[MAD MEW MEW, SUNG]
HEY! YOU! HANDS OFF!
Don't you know not to touch a gal?
YA KNOW THAT TICKLES! QUIT IT PAL!
You caught me in the middle of my mad chorale

You don't know who I am?
OHOHOHO!
That's just great, man!
I left that old life right behind me
Now I'm so kawaii!

Now I'm back in the attack
I saw this body just lyin' around
And you wanna know the epiphany that I had found?

Took one peek, my interest piqued
And I loved, loved, LOVED what I saw!
It was like a mirror
Truly! Truly! TRULY! IT'S ME!!
(Mad laughter)
And now I'm finally feelin' more like me
This could be
My new body!
But all I feel right now is enmity
There's a RAGE that boils at a thousand degrees!
Fusing's gonna take a while
I won't take denial!
DON'T LAUGH AT ME, CHILD!
You looked at me funny the other day
So the time has come for you to pay!

COMBAT! BLOODLUST!!
Time to Switch it up!
TOTAL DESTRUCTION!
This cat's about to blow you up! AHAHAHA!
Foolish! FOOLISH!
You can't run from me!
HOPELESS! HOPELESS!!
I'M NOT SOME TWO BIT DUMMY!

[MAD MEW MEW, SPOKEN]
WHADDYA MEAN I JUST RHYMED ""UP"" WITH ""UP?!""
LEMME TELL YA SOMETHIN', FALLEN HUMAN CHILD!
LYRICS WRITING IS HARD OKAY?!

Wondering where I got this body?
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?! HA HA HA!
Sure, I'll tell ya
I found it in a sciencey place
As soon as I saw this body, I just knew it was me, me, ME!
[MAD MEW MEW, SUNG]
What to do when otaku
Give you the body you truly desire
This is the moment I've waited for!
I'm feelin' like my SOUL's on fire!

Now this cat's on the attack!
All my dreams are about to set sail!
Time to write a new chapter
In the Undertale

In this body I am happy
Can't ya see it through the rage?!
This figure fills me up with joy
This ghost's life's gettin' a new page!

Now I really wanna fuse!
I can't lose
This bod I choose
This is my lifelong dream!
Eureka! Eureka! EUREK- ACK-!

[MAD MEW MEW, SPOKEN]
Ugh... this is harder than it seems

[MAD MEW MEW, SUNG]
Yeah, the transition has been kinda tough
It's been rough
I'm stuffed with fluff
But I just don't think fury is enough
...Maybe my SOUL isn't up to snuff?
But I'm sure that this is me!
Don't ya see?!
IT'S MY DESTINY!
Thanks to this brand-new body!
I GOT A BRAND NEW LIFE AHEAD OF ME!
New life! Cool life!
I'll be the greatest dummy!
Cool life! New life!
Oh, Undyne will ADORE me!
She'll stab me! She'll pierce me!
Wait... she's already got another?
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?!
I'll wish her well and respect her! Mew~!

This is one tough egg to crack
No matter how much I attack
It won't take my monster SOUL
I can't fail so close to my goal!
Maybe this doll's too complex; she
Won't accept my apoplexy!
How can I fuse, tell me how?!

[MAD MEW MEW, SPOKEN]
LET ME TELL YA SOMETHIN' MEW MEW-KISSY CUTIE DOLL BODY!
I NEED YOU TO FUSE WITH ME NOW, NOW, NOW!!

[MAD MEW MEW, SUNG]
What in the world am I doin' wrong?!
IT'S BEEN A WHOLE SONG!
Why's it TAKING so long?!
Has anger been the wrong answer all along?
Is fury actually NOT that strong?
Tell me, tell me, what's the gist?
If the answer ain't bein' pissed
I just don't know what to do
Hey you, help me become Mad Mew Mew!

[MAD MEW MEW, SPOKEN]
(Gasping for breath)
Enough. ENOUGH. ENOUGH!
WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?!
NO MATTER HOW MAD I GET, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT
I JUST CAN'T FUSE WITH THIS BODY!
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?!
...What am I doing wrong...?

H...Huh?
You mean I might have to try...
OTHER emotions?
You mean something like...
Like love?
Then, I...hm...
H-Human! Go ahead. Show me what love is!

H-Huh?
Such...such kindness!

Dizaster vs Unanymous,rap,Don't Flop,2013,1057,"{Dizaster,""Don\\'t Flop"",Unanymous}","[Round 1: Dizaster]
My tea's gone cold up inside and I can't see at all
The morning rain clouds on his window
And I can't see at all
And even if he could it'd all be glad
He hung my pictures on my wall
It reminds him that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Diz', I wrote you but you ain't responded
I sent you two DM's back in autumn, you must not of got 'em
They're probably just lost in the Don't Flop office or something
Anyway, y'all wanna know what rhymes with ""Unanymous""?
""Huge fan of Diz'""
You know what else rhymes with ""Unanymous""?
""Psychosis slapped the fuck out of this pussy, knocked the cigarette out of his mouth and he didn't do shit.""
Stop acting like you gon' push me
You gon' talk, get on and on like you go violent and you whoop me
Yeah, you gon' talk about how you a real fighter that can whoop me
Soon as I take your ass outside you gon' start crying like a...pussy!
You ain't a monstrosity Thomas

[Unanymous]
I ain't gonna do the battle with him stood behind me man. Man, like what the fuck?
[Dizaster]
Fucking pussy. Everybody make some noise for the pussy!
You're not a monstrosity Thomas, today you're gonna learn what the difference is
Cause time after time, Psychosis forgave for going online and running your mouth like a little bitch
Time after time he forgave you, you came back and you did the shit
So after it's over and it's over, well you have some unfinished business with
This man over here over that Twitter shit
And I don't even have another round so go ahead and finish this

{Psychosis gets in Unanymous's face and then acts like he's going to punch him}

What did I tell you about that Twitter shit?
It's obvious you a pussy cause he just flinched like a little bitch
Yo hold on though, same shit he did with Shotty though
You know he brought up his dead relative in an attempt to try to hurt him
You know he trying to show he's a monstrosity but I know there's a nicer type of version
He got all violent, started cursing like, ""I'll mention your dead relatives""
And he was like, ""I'll bang you out"" and you're like, ""No, no, bruv, dead relatives, I wasn't going to apply it in a verse
Shotty I haven't told you how much I like you as a person
The fundamentals of you being an MC have been breached
Cause everything we stand for is freedom of speech
And Shotty made you eat your words til you can't even speak
Say it, ""I'm a monstrosity"" say it, it's battle rap bitch
It's battle rap, you know the policy, there's no apology
Unless Shotty is two seconds away from taking my dome and stomping me
[?] no real cheddar
He got his homie massaging his back right now to make him feel better
Keep on giving him help you little pussy, you're nothing but a pathetic square
Cause when Shotty made him go blank he was looking really helpless there
You're like Kurt Cobain cause the last time a shotty went off in your face your brains got scattered everywhere
Fuck is wrong with this fucking pussy?
Round one, y'all know his slogan, it's getting hot in here
And y'all know his slogan
[Crowd]
Get 'em the fuck outta here

[Dizaster]
No get this little fucking midget the fuck out of here
[?] the fuck outta here
You little fucking pussy, don't tell us how you gon' buck the uzi
Okay you little pudgy, droopy, fucking clumsy, goofy, Augustus Gloop-y
Chunk from The Goonies, the chubby kid from every fucking movie
This kid is so chunky to me if he took both his hands and cupped his boobies it'd look like onion [?]

[Round 1: Unanymous]
So you wanna get hype and all up in my shit like you spark the chrome?
Nah, wearing that body warm is the only time you've ever had arms on show
I saw some shit, you wanna talk about me being a pussy, right?
I saw some shit yesterday that made you look like a buttercup
You didn't actually come here to battle me you came here to lick Sophie Cody and bust a nut
That's Mickey's ex, a known fucking slut
And when Mickey and Double L got in your face you didn't do shit and they was threatening to fuck you up!
You were too busy concentrating on protecting Lu's pussy
To see Double L throwing cans around
But I guess that's what happens when you travel seven hours on a plane for fuck Mickey Worthless's hand me downs
Now before I get gruesome and nasty
Let me make this shit clear so that you understand me
The majority wanna see me lose the shit badly
They'd love to see you abuse and attack an arrogant fat little British battle rapper with crooked and cracked teeth
But win or loss, I'm 21, just take a look at the rap sheet
I'm only sorry to the fans for not being as good as I can be
Yo, and that's a humble statement
I'm back on my bullshit
That slip up against Villun was disappointing but nothing major
I choked up and he won let's face it
I don't wanna punch his face in
I just wanna say that
If my mom was shooting heroin during her pregnancy with me, what the fuck was his mother taking?
Cause when you all thought Villun fed me that slice of humble pie
He did, but I had an allergic reaction that doubled my stomach size
Don't get it fucked up, it's still Unanymous, the dragon rapper
It's all just warlocks and salamanders when I'm writing a verse
I'll strike the eye of God's eyes and Isengard with a lightening surge
Then He can [?] with so many crystals that Heisenberg will have to find a different line of work
But fuck a meth basement, my chemistry is less basic
You can bring an Arsonal, we'll leave with his dreads shaven
Walking like Forest Gump with the leg braces
This is like feeding a sheep to a wolverine, you'll get your head caved in
I'm X rated, the ax raise into your neck strained in ten places
Eyes shooting beams with TEC's aim
But if you can let an Uzi or a Tec scream
Well then it's fuck what you can be, I'm shooting dreams like Wes Craven
A new light is entering, the final testament
Set fire to Genesis
I rewrite an Exodus so that Christ remembers that I tried correcting it
Yeah bitch, Bible references
You know what else rhymes with ""Bible references""?
""Al-Qaeda terrorist""
You ain't fucking with me cause my frame go like a primate from the Ice Age
But my mind frame? Like an exorcist
I'll pride you open and fight the demons that are colonizing inside your skeleton
And get devilish so the Devil recognized as Heaven sent
Pussy
So the Devil recognized as Heaven sent, I'll never forget
{Unanymous sees Dizaster motion to Philly Swain and Mickey Worthless}

What's going on?
Go for it

[Round 2: Dizaster]
So he said I came out here for so I could fuck with some ho
All I gotta say is Mickey, was that shit true?

[Mickey Worthless]
No

[Unanymous]
But it is

[DIzaster]
So protect yourself, cause [?]
He thinks he figured out which bitch I'm fucking when he can't even get a date on his own
Fuck it, even if I did, somehow, happen to come here for a bitch I wanted to date
Yeah I wouldn't fly 7,000 miles for hand-me-downs but I still won't bake her a cake
His guy's a fucking pussy bro, don't even bother
He's like, ""Hold on. I'm not choking. Let me grab me a water.""
Cause there's nothing he could do or say, this guy wants to be me
So I'ma do it real quick without doing a free
Check it out, he wants to mimic me, he wants to live my life, no?
No? No, you don't want? Then kill the hype
You little fucking midget height
Little white piece of shit that's vicariously trying to live his life through me cause he can't seem to get his image right
Man, at first when I seen him, I was like, ""Okay, he does lyrically bite.""
Then he took my facial expressions too and I was literally like, ""You gotta be fucking kidding me, right?""
Me and this kid are so alike
When I came up here and saw him I was like, ""Yo, you ready to give me my biggest fight?""
And he's like, ""Bruv, you already know I didn't write.""
This shit is bullshit, alright
He has me thinking like, ""Maybe me and him do think alike.""
But the only reason I think that cause he always wants to think like me so I be thinking that the shit is tight
Because well, that's what I be thinking like
This guy's nickname should be ""Dick"" cause all he does is mimic Mikes
Not only did you take my lyrics but also stole my wrapping/rapping presence (presents) like the Grinch of Christmas Night
You've full of shit Unan', kill the hype
You attacked Villun, called him out and still got killed despite
You're like a mosquito, cause you attack the skin of everything in sight
But it's often delivered with a bite
So how the fuck are you gonna give some albino kid that bites
When you're the fucking dude that wants to be me cause he can't even get his image right
At least everyday Villun wakes up and never has to stare into the mirror twice
This shit is stereotypical
This guy, this guy wants to be so much like me if the music in his stereo isn't Arabic enough to listen to
You'd probably force your parents to live with you
I feel like Captain Sparrow sharing a room with a parrot that constantly sits there and it mimics you
Like, ""Faggot! Faggot!""
Anyway, they told me to pick these pens up
So when I did, what I seen, I was extremely fed up
I said, if I hear you with one of your little fucking repetitive schemes, the set up is how
Bruv, you're gonna roll up and pull out your little weak Beretta I'm gonna
Immediately have to leak you
Repetitively stab you with a sewing needle so you start to leak through your sweater
Sweep you off the feet with a concrete meat cleaver
Til you start to leak through your sweater
I'll have you by your Achilles tendon completely severed
And then I'll slap a bag on your head and grab a nail gun and staple both your knees together
He starts to breathe, I told him, ""It's okay Unan'. Breathe like me, things get better
It's okay, I'll give you that number, three with the edge up
Yet I'll let you bleed from neck up
Japanese machete, I'll leave pieces of flesh cut
I'll fucking pierce your tongue with a fishing string tied around your neck three times and tell you to ""keep your head up""
I'll fucking punch you in your face pussy you know what the fucking talk's about
Don't fucking dare me right now cause we'll shut this whole fucking venue down
And everybody gonna still [?]
Stop fucking pushing me cause I will fucking slap you dead
Do it one more time
Do it one more time
Smack the hat off your head

[Round 2: Unanymous]
Somebody better tell him ""chill"" before he gets his soul killed
You got a motorized jaw muscle
I've got the motor skills to this rodent to road kill
So slick witted so sickening, so ill
The way I put it together is so real so quick that you won't feel
Try to study the structure of my pen and get it dug into your flesh like Michael Scofield
You should've known it was a curtain call as soon as you thought to battle me
One Dizaster ain't enough, you'd need four to battle me
I don't give a fuck if you bang hammers, you'd need Thor to battle me
You was begging for Eurgh's attention bitch, you fought to battle me
That's a .44 for your anatomy
Everything I draw's a masterpiece
Plus when you're friends with Okwerdz in real life then you lose automatically
Slow it down, I said when you're friends with Okwerdz in real life then you lose automatically
Yeah, yeah he's a pussy basically
I don't give a fuck if you're from the west side, there ain't nothing west side about him
I checked him Instagram, I saw him throwing up west sides and pouting
I can imagine Okwerdz like, ""Yo Diz' you got this Unan' battle coming up fam'. You wanna hit the mall? I mean let's buy an outfit.""
And he's like, ""No Ryan. Let's give each other back breakers and then climb a mountain.""
I mean how the fuck could you bring yourself to befriend that fat head and degenerate prick?
When you get back to America remember to tell him I told you to tell him he's got a head like a blimp
No when you get back to America remember to tell him I told you to him he's BITCH
If it wasn't for his incredibly rich parents he would never exist
So the next time he wants to give my name a mentional flip
I'll trap a venomous fist in his father's chemotherapy drip
I don't wanna get personal with you, you know?
Cause if I get personal with you then your family's trees won't have any room to grow
Like let's get ignorant, right?
Yeah? Yeah? I'll rape your mother on her prayer mat
Rip her veil off and fuck her bareback
I will tie your faggot father up and leave that Iraqi drone with fractured bones
Sliced up inside of Bin Laden's hole
Then drag his body to his mansion where he wants to watch his family grow
With a ransom note carved into his chest that says, ""Daddy's home""
You're center stage with Leatherface, let the fact be known
He ain't someone I'm trying to emulate, I stand alone
I know I can make the weather change with my angered flow
But what I display is a unique art
So you'd need heart to create where Dizaster [?]
I will fucking backhand slap your grandma
Back breaker your grandpa and repo the grenades he's armed with
Pull the pin out every one of them motherfuckers
And leave nothing but the rubble from a blood stained apartment
So call the ""Blood Stain Department""
A new level of homicide is surfacing
Another self righteous person
I'll fucking- try to undermine me I'll cut him like a surgeon
Give this dickhead a circumcision and leave him with his turban split
Just cause Daylyt's in your clique
Don't mean you're from them Compton sides where a Glock will fly
Pussy you're from the posher side of Berkeley
If you wanted a yacht your family butler would hop online and purchase it
I know every time a suicide bomber dies it hurts a bit
But remember that locked inside it's their job their pride, they work for it
Fuck the humble approach
I will send everyone in attendance at your mosque to die in serpent pits
And I don't give a fuck if you think that's too far Kumar
Cause if there was an elephant in the room you'd be fucking trying to worship it!
You don't like that?
""Mr. Dizaster. And when people mention I'm an A-rab I hate that
But back when I battled A-Class and spat a bunch of Asian hate raps about stray cats and train tracks.""
Fuck that
I hope fucking Kim Jong bombs your continent
I hope he turns Lebanon Hiroshima
And if the bomb blast doesn't catch it was a set of
Chop sticks that cuts off your oxygen as you slowly feel loss of consciousness
And cough your tonsils up with a blocked esophagus
Cause when I seen you using all these race jokes
I just think, ""Well, what the fuck is wrong with it? Has he not got a conscious?""
Cause when the shoe's on the other foot he's not as tolerant
So either being the world's biggest fucking hypocrite is his one accomplishment
Or this racist piece of shit must've lost his confidence like Tony Robinson
To the past accusations state that I have used racism but
But here stands a man that demonizes his own race for the sake of entertainment
Cause he knows that he can play on it
And all you fans will just take to it
Cause subconsciously the majority of western civilization has been brainwashed to think
That a peaceful Muslim is non-existent like a Guantanamo Bay visit
Now that's racism on an international scale
And in that case, since you were Canada's champ
I'll travel and wrap Organik in plastic explosives and throw a couple grenades with it
So King Of The Dot can say I blew up the spot the way that Hussein did it
Listen Bachir, you Indian queer
Most top tier rappers would leave what looks like maroon paint dripping from your Blue Jay's fitted
I understand that you beat Canibus but how hard could that have been if LL Cool J did it

{Eurgh calls time}

[Unanymous]
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck about time
They just all wanna see you fall
Dizaster complaining about the time limits? Now I've seen it all

[Round 3: Dizaster]
That shit he just said at the end just exposed the inner bitch in you
Bro, your personality is beyond split in two
There's like six of you
This guy wants to take all my lyrics, my stage presence, fine
But you also wanna go over the time limits too?
I got a challenge for you, if you accept it it'll be hard
I dare you not to take one of my schemes and breathe hard
And stretch your multi's every three bars
Fuck Unan', he said some shit about a prayer mat
And now he's gonna fucking hit her bareback, right?
But your mother blaze crack
You know why I would say that?
Cause she's the only person on Earth that's ever found the needle in the haystack
You already know my bars got conviction
Bro, Tommy that was a good line but you're not supposed to clap when someone is making fun of your mama's addition
And normally, being an addict, they don't do it in front of people, it makes them quite uncomfortable
But this shit has gotten so bad with your mom now she doesn't even hide it from you dude
You're drinking your Sprite and she takes it from you
Turns the soda can into a pipe in front of you
Like, ""What's this guy here gonna do?""
""Mom you better stop before I turn into a minor adjustable
Rhyming corruptible, mighty adjustable"" - shut the fuck up bitch you ain't gonna fucking do shit
Before I start violently punching you
You ain't gon' fire a fucking tool
You just a deprived little child who lies about the crimes he do
To justify why your mother was too high to provide somewhat of a life for you
He developed the ability to learn telepathy
He's a monstrosity that knows all kinds of stuff
He developed telepathy from being able to communicate with his pregnant mom from being inside her gut
He be like, ""Mum. It's me. Do you have speed inside your blood?
I know you can't sleep but you need to try for once
You did heroin all week, please don't light that blunt
You hear that? Doonk doonk doonk. That's the sound of our heartbeat rising you need to read between the lines you cunt
That means that we're high as fuck!
Really, life must suck, when you're a baby, you send your mom a signal that she needs to provide a lunch
Her instincts tell her, ""Hmm, I should probably feed him designer drugs.""
I bet my top dollar you were conceived in an [?] club
Where I'm from this guy's a thug
He earned his stripes before life begun like a tiger cub
First time he entered inside a club this guy's so young
When the bouncer asked for his ID he read it, it said ""Minus 1""
So stop coming with this fake front
You always putting on for Youtube trying to convince everybody Tommy Vilas deranged and he got loose screws
Bro, you not abused by the system, you just let the system abuse you
Maybe if you read a book or two, every once in a while ran some wisdom through you
You'd finally get this but you don't get it do you?
Your homies that you grew up with in Plymouth they don't ever listen to you
Cause they see through this false image that you built, it doesn't fit or suit you
Always talking about ""I'ma roll up in clubs and shoot you.""
Bitch you ain't gonna shoot nobody but the reputation is how everybody in England views you
Cause when you say you a killer, we know you ain't a killer
Consider it like self inflicted voodoo
Cause that same knife you piercing through other people is really just piercing through you
Your mom is a crackhead!
She likes to stuff heroin in her blunt and spark it
It's clear that this battle wasn't your department
You've been crushed before this started
Fuck a battle with Dizaster, you should be battling DNA to be see who's mother is more retarded
Shock value bro
You don't even know who's Unanymous
Bruv you don't even know Unanymous
You're a fucking buck tooth platypus
Still looking for a tooth to snaggle with
You stupid flabby bitch
Here's some useful steps for you to improve your assets with
First, use the salad dish
Two, do some calisthenics to reduce your boobs to half their width
I know you can do it Tommy, you're super talented
Once you got as high as a computer analyst
Got fired the same day got sued for damages
Because he got caught illegally downloading groups of sandwiches
You hang around him it's like experiencing a lucid acid trip
Cause he moves his hands real quick like he's doing now and food just vanishes
This guy would probably be the worst dude to travel with
He's always the guy sitting in front of you with his chair like, ""Bruv', can I move back a bit?""
But do that make sense?
Of course not cause he even if me and you were on the same plane together
You want to be so much like me, you would've crashed the shit
Could you imagine being a pilot on a travel jet
They radio him in from the tower like, ""Um, Captain Unanymous? What would you like to choose as your landing strip?""
And he's like, ""Ahh, I'd like to use Dizaster's dick.""
So I'ma just let him be
You can never fuck with me
You got all your homies talking shit to me endlessly
How about you Arkaic?
You wanna fucking fight [?]
You talk a lot of shit in my face
You said- SHUT THE FUCK UP
I will jump kick you from right up here you son of a bitch
Eh, I told him ""just let it be."" He's mad at me right now saying I don't got words and melody
At least I'm not the one who showed up over here looking like a gay referee
Faggot, pussy, bitch
Don't fuck with me cause ain't no limit to the disrespectful shit I""ll do

[Arkaic]
Snitch, snitch, snick

[Dizaster]
Man, I'ma fuck this guy up bro
Ain't no limit to the disrespectful shit I'll do
If you keep talking shit, after this, when Stephanie ask me for the interview
First thing I'ma say to that bitch is, ""Let me stick my dick in you.""
Mark ass pussy throwing my shit off
Sitting over here all mad
Why even show up to the battle all yapping
Talking 'bout, ""Remember, The Saurus we didn't get to battle.""
He was like, ""Ho, ho, ho I guess it's back to gambling.""
And you was like, ""Oh no I guess it's never gonna happen.""
He fucking made me forget my shit
Fucking hate you. I hope you fucking die you pussy
Fuck this guy up
I'ma take this guy's cup
Hold up, let me rap to you
You know what? I'm taking this too far I'ma give it back to you
Cause I don't want this [?] some shit where it causes a riot
Cause ain't no fucking denying he's gonna end up crying
And when I mean crying, I mean crying like Charlie Clips when water is flying
I really fucking hate you bro
For doing this shit with your man
Cause I can't even get back to where I am
You fucking Afgani-Stan
And since I can't get back to where I was at
I'ma end this with a song but this time it's the same one in the intro except y'all gon' it along
Y'all ready?
My tea's gone cold up inside and I can't see at all
The morning rain clouds on his window
And he can't see at all
And even if he could it'd all be glad
He hung my pictures on his wall
It reminds him that I'm Unanymous's dad, I'm Unanymous's dad

[Round 3: Unanymous]
Now I knew he'd mention my mother and the smack she consumes
But that only draws attention to the time you battled on Smack and got snapped into two
Now even though none of them statements are factually true
If she was on smack, that smack probably came from the opium pipes
That your Afghan family grew
And she birthed me, which technically mean I'm more of a Smack rapper than you!
Right now it's supposed to be like, ""Finally, daddy's spending time with me""
Yeah fucking right, I mean, fuck the comparisons
We ain't family that ain't actually equal, just cause both our personalities evil
In fact I'd be embarrassed to be you
If you were my biological donor, you'd be a disgrace to my family gene pool with all that-
""I run up on a retarded kid
Rip off his colostomy bag and replace it with the oxygen gas""
Fuck them gymnastic type, theatrics might
Samurai dagger might inflict you with gashes and deep wounds
When I hack your [?] and after you've had your bandages removed
I'll shatter your dreams when I pull up to your next battle in a black tinted Regal
Brandished evil and start blasting at people like Apache Marine shoot
I'm the GOAT, I'm the proper type and I don't think Dizaster's the sequel
No, I said I'm a prototype and I don't think Dizaster is equal
Now against Arsonal you broke down how you can't spell ""bars"" without putting that ""arse"" in it
Whether Arsonal [?] started with the word ""bar"" and convinced yourself it was artistic
But if you're gonna pick apart and break down Arsonal's bars using the word ""bar"" then you need to be smart with it
Don't just bark the word ""bar"" and actually put some bars in it!
But it's hard for him cause this retard isn't smart with it
But him? It's all just performing arts and drama a facade really
His bars timid if you give them a hard listen
Well I'm a bear with it so I'ma bare with him let bars hit him
Get barbaric and let a barbell bomb hit him
Start bitching, I take the lead cause he just bark vicious
So your terrorist threats, I should directly address you a FedEx parcel with SARS in it
A barrage of hard hits that comatose you like my bars are actually barbiturates
I don't give a fuck if Dizaster be crafting his bars until it's scratching off his fingertips
Cause THAT is the only reason he compares himself in his bars
To people like the main character in Limitless
Just cause all his fucking bars and battles are unlimited
Well my bars aren't actually bars
They're shards that have been carved into sharpened instruments
Perfectly equipped for performing cardio incisions
Once I'm bar charting your heart's fitness with a stethoscope sampling metronomes from your heart's rhythm
My bars is dope as bars of coke you know
My bars is cold as Antarctic poles
Fuck Barbados I got my own city of bars I call it Barcelona
And parts of it harvest Spartan type barbarians that don't give a fuck about no bars
Just crowbars to your [?] chest set and give your heart conditions
You'll leave Leeds looking like an elite team of [?]
Parts of him missing like a school of piranhas bitten
You're barely a barnacle, it's like someone threw a barracuda where a shark was swimming
I'll fucking waterboard and torture ya whore of a mother
Till she admits to American military she was Bin Laden's mistress
That fucking Sari's stinking!
As for bars, she needs to be charged for giving a bar of soap
And told she'd be barricaded behind bars if she don't immediately clean up her armpits with it
Yeah, you'll get barred barless, my bars cut carcasses [?] blood so
Brace yourself or catch bars to your grill like a monster truck
I'll break down and condense your bars into hockey pucks
And bring shots to ya like a bartender
You're a bitch and your bars tender
My bars, each of my bars [?] is as fat as Andy Milonakis
It seems as if the fans, think we have some similarities but I'm deading that
Cause I'm a different rapper so cut the chitter chatter and get your raps up
Or forensics will find it's just [?] actions and a list of victims while the city watches
You need way more than just a handful of bars
I've got a hungry fat kid mentality
I'll rapidly rip a rapper apart
To beat me, you need Wolverine's adamantium arms
A tarantula with Dracula's heart
A praying mantis with fangs like a shark
Pretty much a whole fucking pad of Unanymous bars!",3166698,en,en,en,my teas gone cold up inside and i cant see at all the morning rain clouds on his window and i cant see at all and even if he could

they was threatening to fuck you up you were too busy concentrating on protecting lus pussy to see double l throwing cans around but i guess thats what happens when you travel seven hours on a plane for fuck mickey worthlesss hand me downs now before i get gruesome and nasty let me make this shit clear so that you understand me the majority wanna see me lose the shit badly theyd love to see you abuse and attack an arrogant fat little british battle rapper with crooked and cracked teeth but win or loss im just take a look at the rap sheet im only sorry to the fans for not being as good as i can be yo and thats a humble statement im back on my bullshit that slip up against villun was disappointing but nothing major i choked up and he won lets face it i dont wanna punch his face in i just wanna say that if my mom was shooting heroin during her pregnancy with me what the fuck was his mother taking cause when you all thought villun fed me that slice of humble pie he did but i had an allergic reaction that doubled my stomach size dont get it fucked up its still unanymous the dragon rapper its all just warlocks and salamanders when im writing a verse ill strike the eye of gods eyes and isengard with a lightening surge then he can with so many crystals that heisenberg will have to find a different line of work but fuck a meth basement my chemistry is less basic you can bring an arsonal well leave with his dreads shaven walking like forest gump with the leg braces this is like feeding a sheep to a wolverine youll get your head caved in im x rated the ax raise into your neck strained in ten places eyes shooting beams with tecs aim but if you can let an uzi or a tec scream well then its fuck what you can be im shooting dreams like wes craven a new light is entering the

go for it so he said i came out here for so i could fuck with some ho all i gotta say is mickey was that shit true no but it is so protect yourself cause he thinks he figured out which bitch im fucking when he cant even get a date on his own fuck it even if i did somehow happen to come here for a bitch i wanted to date yeah i wouldnt fly miles for handmedowns but i still wont bake her a cake his guys a fucking pussy bro dont even bother hes like hold on im not choking let me grab me a water cause theres nothing he could do or say this guy wants to be me so ima do it real quick without doing a free check it out he wants to mimic me he wants to live my life no no no you dont want then kill the hype you little fucking midget height little white piece of shit thats vicariously trying to live his life through me cause he cant seem to get his image right man at first when i seen him i was like okay he does lyrically bite then he took my facial expressions too and i was literally like you gotta be fucking kidding me right me and this kid are so alike when i came up here and saw him i was like yo you ready to give me my biggest fight and hes like bruv you already know i didnt write this shit is bullshit alright he has me thinking like maybe me and him do think alike but the only reason i think that cause he always wants to think like me so i be thinking that the shit is tight because well thats what i be thinking like this guys nickname should be dick cause all he does is mimic mikes not only did you take my lyrics but also stole my wrappingrapping presence presents like the grinch of christmas night youve full of shit unan kill the hype you attacked villun called him out and still got killed despite youre like a mosquito cause you attack the skin of everything in sight but its often delivered with a bite so how the fuck are you gonna give some albino kid that bites when youre the fucking dude that wants to be me cause he cant even get his image right at least everyday villun wakes up and never has to stare into the mirror twice this shit is stereotypical this guy this guy wants to be so much like me if the music in his stereo isnt arabic enough to listen to youd probably force your parents to live with you i feel like captain sparrow sharing a room with a parrot that constantly sits there and it mimics you like faggot faggot anyway they told me to pick these pens up so when i did what i seen i was extremely fed up i said if i hear you with one of your little fucking repetitive schemes the set up is how bruv youre gonna roll up and pull out

apart and break down arsonals bars using the word bar then you need to be smart with it dont just bark the word bar and actually put some bars in it but its hard for him cause this retard isnt smart with it but him its all just performing arts and drama a facade really his bars timid if you give them a hard listen well im a bear with it so ima bare with him let bars hit him get barbaric and let a barbell bomb hit him start bitching i take the lead cause he just bark vicious so your terrorist threats i should directly address you a fedex parcel with sars in it a barrage of hard hits that comatose you like my bars are actually barbiturates i dont give a fuck if dizaster be crafting his bars until its scratching off his fingertips cause that is the only reason he compares himself in his bars to people like the main character in limitless just cause all his fucking bars and battles are unlimited well my bars arent actually bars theyre shards that have been carved into sharpened instruments perfectly equipped for performing cardio incisions once im bar charting your hearts fitness with a stethoscope sampling metronomes from your hearts rhythm my bars is dope as bars of coke

Shout to DJ Screw, all I wanted was some swangers
Shout to DJ Drama, all I wanted was a gangster grill
Shout to DJ Screw, all I wanted was some swangers
Shout to DJ Drama, all I wanted was a gangster grill

[Interlude]
All I wanted was some swangers
All I wanted was some swangers
All I wanted was a gangster grill
All I wanted was some swangers

[Verse 1]
Young nigga had big dreams, box Caprice, candy paint
Pull up on the scene with the mixed bred, puerto rican, Spanish thang
I just want to make buku, everything new-new
Wanna do a show in Honolulu
Feeling like I’m talking to myself with this new truth
Like a nigga walking with the Bluetooth
I’m important to the city, riding down Jordan lane, Jordan of the city
Going through growing pains, growing in the city
One day you might pop Concords in a fitted
Next day, locked with the ward in the prison
Top floor can you hear me? I’m just tryna do right by God
30,000 feet up in the air I swear a young nigga feel right by God
I remember we was rapping through cubase,uncut like ScHoolboy Q’s face
Use to cover our zits with the toothpaste, airforce ones, switching up the shoelace
Imma heal the world, Michael Jackson
These niggas funny, Michael Blackson
After a while you get tired of closed doors, time to open up
I heard “pysch” so much I went psychopathic!
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And I still got big dreams, the best weed, seats plush
Banging that Doe B trap music, something’s banging in the trunk
Young nigga this the Marshall Mathers type of shit
I killed it dog, Michael Vick
I built it all, I’m like a brick
I didn’t own no pot to piss, was hanging on apostrophes
I just want to cop a 6, eliminate the competition
Complicate the common sense, and compilate the compliments
And thinking back I’m like
(Shout to DJ Screw, all I wanted was some swingers)
Conversate anonymous, and contemplate hypothesis
A weed smoke esophagus, an Alabama narcissist
Shake it like it’s Parkinson’s, I bought my car I’m marketing
I’m hard to miss, I’m calling on a conference of all of my accomplices
When niggas talking shit, I’m off the bridge, confiscate your confidence
And obligate the audience, and show em' buying J’s is not accomplishment!
Young nigga this HuntsVegas [HUNTSVEGAS], back in middle school we was lunch takers
But in the rap game we the undertakers, young nigga

Alive,pop,Patrick Edwin,2020,8,{},"I don't need designer clothes
Take away the dollar signs
What are we left with at the end of everything
We've been living half asleep
Time to open up our eyes
What if we did, just imagine we could feel so alive

Yeah, sitting on your phone, playing music
Scrolling through the people that you're cool with
Yeah, sometimes it feels it ain't fair
How come all the cool stuff happens every time that you're not there
They live in the better house, and they wear the cooler clothes
They get everything they want and people like all of their posts
Get to go wherever whenever they want with all their friends
Cause they got the coolest parents
And yours just don't understand
If they got it, you gotta have it to be like your friends
How you ever 'sposed ta be one of the popular kids
It feels unfair, wish you could do all the things that they do
But what's inside of you is beautiful, yeah, through and through
I don't need designer clothes
Take away the dollar signs
What are we left with at the end of everything
We've been living half asleep
Time to open up our eyes
What if we did, just imagine we could feel so alive

Forget the norm, you ain't gotta conform
We all given everything that we really need when we born
Cause you were made with perfection
Even your flaws
You are complete, just be who you are
Don't let nobody else bring you down, cause you're an angel
Believe if you can't see it now, we go through changes
Like a butterfly, grow your wings and transform
You are unique, a rose among thrones

If they do it, you gotta do it to be like your friends
How you ever 'posed to be one of the popular kids
It feels unfair, wish you got all of those things that they post
It's what inside of you that matters the most, yeah

I don't need designer clothes
Take away the dollar signs
What are we left with at the end of everything

[Verse]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Let me take you back
15 years old now
Boy without a dream
See I was so down
Looking for answers
Too many questions that I had
Like if I never wake up
Would anyone even be sad?
Would anyone remember me?
Oh no
Would anybody send for me?
Oh no
Always knew that I was different
Was no point in tryna fit in
So I dipped
Oh
So I dipped
Hoping I’d fall off the face of the planet
And never come back
But then I found you
And I knew that you wouldn’t have it
So
I learned what it meant to be
A man who’s stronger mentally
You filled me with pride inside
Through you I realized
That greater things are meant for me
Might be counted out
But I’ll be atop the world eventually
Believe in what you say
Call it manifest destiny
I can’t predict the round
But I’ll fight till nothin’ left in me
'Cause you did it for me
Oh yeah
You gave me hope when I needed a lifeline
Taught me lessons that’ll last for a lifetime
Mmmm-hmmm-mmmm
Yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
See you in the sky one day

Hold Me by the Heart,pop,Kehlani,2017,69406,{},"[Intro]
When it comes to relationships, um
I truly feel like wholeness can come from brokenness
We can find love in the most strange places
Um, that we didn't expect
And I think that's the beauty in love
I think that's the beauty in connecting with other people
Through our hurt, through our growth
And through the struggle

[Verse 1]
Wasn't sure I'd be alright
Wasn't sure I'd be okay again
Didn't know how to take flight
Wings broken couldn't seem to bend

[Pre-Chorus]
Somehow you came in like the wind
And picked me up for good
And now I know what I have missed
I'm thinking that you should
[Chorus]
Pick up the pieces
Help me learn to stand
Lift me from the ground and use your hands
To hold me by the heart
Tell me I'll be whole again
Hold me by the heart
Tell me it will never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So baby, hold me by the heart (Hold me by the heart)
Help me fly again

[Verse 2]
Always read all the fairytales
Always knew that it would come
Through the pain I convinced myself
""It's only magical for some""

[Pre-Chorus]
Somehow you came and like a prince
And picked me up for good
And now I know what I have missed
I'm thinking that you should

[Chorus]
Just pick up the pieces
Help me learn to stand
Lift me from the ground and use your hands
To hold me by the heart
Tell me I'll be whole again
And hold me by the heart
Tell me it will never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So baby, hold me by the heart (Hold me by the heart)
Help me fly again
[Outro]
(Pick up the pieces)
(Help me learn to stand)
Help me learn to stand
(Lift me from the ground and)
Use your hands
(Pick up the pieces) Hey

Help me learn to stand

Use your hands
Use your hands

Fibs,rap,Diverse One,2020,30,"{""Sofia (UK)""}","(Intro: Diverse One)
Ooooh

(Verse 1: Diverse One)
Such a pretty little liar, you remind me of Aria
We don't fight that often, I never wanted to leave ya
Even when we do it ain't the Deal
But Last beef was so saucy I couldve opened up a Grill
I still like you, despite you spited me
We broke up and when I asked why you fighted me
Well not really but you turn everything into a discussion
Which evolves to big thing, which hurts my head more than any concussion
People derided me for the longevity of my love for you, I thought to myself ""it better be""
Worth it, surely she'll think about getting back, we spent a great month together, in fact
I just got her a gift and we ain't even together, that should show her how much she means to me it better
Shit what am I doing? Am I screwing up again? Fuck

(Hook: Sofia)
You Left Me as Shattered As Your IPhone Screen
Our relationship was a fantasy, a dream, Why you telling fibs, Why you telling fibs You make me wanna hit you in the ribs
I should've known you weren't nice as you seem
I should've just deflected your love beam Why you telling fibs, Why you telling fibs
I wish you don't exist

(Verse 2: Diverse One)
Ok so she took the gift and seemed to be pretty, happy but the condition I was in was really shitty
I had failed an exam and was in no mood, for what I knew she was gonna say, if what I'm thinkings true
She's gonna be incisive and be like I know you still like me, but I'm sorry It will never happen and Diverse Precisely
I'd be happy to be friends with you, this is not the end with you, we can still do a lot of shit together and it's better too
But she just took the gift without blurting a word, just gave me body language talk man it was really absurd and... It was really absurd, fuck

(Verse 3: Diverse One)
It's been a month and still I'm shaking thinking, is there at least a glimmer of hope, damn my stomach aching
Cuz Ive finally wrote her a text saying I'm still, in love with you and hit me back and if you will
Please think of it before hand, before you kill my hope, think of all the consequences before you say nope
It'd be awkward between us two, impeccably our love can last, cuz I still got some hope so think before you end it fast
I was gonna click send but then my mind and my heart, became two separate teams and yo it was hard
To decipher what they what they was telling me, but I think that one was saying
Send it the other said you don't need this girl she pains you

I think I give up, but no one is oblivious to knowin, cuz I've always told them I will keep on going
Til get her, cuz I'm a patient person, but enough is enough, she will never change for certain
And she's the one who hurt why should I keep going lengths, and my reputation now's so bad I don't even got no strengths
So this is it, cuz there are boundaries and this has reached an extremity, and I don't
Got the patience for that are you feeling me
And this was based on true events in my life but not all real, but only 10% isn't and yo here's the deal
I tried moving on from alleen about six months ago, but theres still a bit of her in my core shit ion know

Right smack in the depth of your soul you'll find a core the purity of which is begging to start you from the front BANG the gun goes off, the run is weak, and you barely left your seat
Meanwhile, these iniquities are knocking on your doors

Find a place with a tiger that will frighten you into fearing fearing
However you do it, make sure that you travel light years away from here and
Come back full circle and prove to me you've learned something outside of your shortcomings

Force yourself to get undressed
Be naked and a tad irate
Solutions to your hopelessness
Motion and no luxury
Taking only what you need
Appropriately hungry
Loosen these shackles and be freed

Afraid that it was only just a dream

Blazing and scheming
Like am I waking or sleeping
I can’t tell hate me or need me
This damn girl crazy I mean it
I’m begging make up your mind
Cah i need to make up my mind
I can’t sleep I’m tossing and turning
And bottle popping and gurning
I’m burning
More than I ever did
Knowing your the one telling me quit
I’m forced to rebel when your sticking
Thoughts in my melon I didn’t
Mean to be rude but I’m sick of speaking to you
All this trickery I can’t take it
I grab that re up and break it
Then bake it
Taking my mind of angels
Taking these demons out of my mind
Onto my TV all over my gaff
Now onto my phone I’m checking my snap
Each second and waiting for your name and еmojis to
Make an appearance or for a rеason for me to pick up the phone
Ain’t got none surely I’ll sip up the rest then get some

I've got needs I've got demons 
Yeah I see them in my dreams 
That's why I need pink or purple
Or there's no way i'ma sleep 
Can't keep my name out your mouth
Just want my woman and my weed 
That's why we're laying on the couch
I blow my spliff whilst she blows me
Overseas we do the same
On the beach, on a plane
Eurostar that's a train, I'ma star she say I'm vain
I say I know but it's ok 
Because she know I numb the pain 
I'm in her heart, i'm in her brain 
I'm in her belly,  i'm in her vein 
I'm on the telly, just hit my celly
What you need? Be there in twenny 
I stop on the way, I cop the henny
I sip the henny, just bunned a zeggy
I'm waved already (waved already)
I might just dead it (I might just dead it)
Nah I'm just playing (nah I'm just playing)
Gotta get the dough (gotta get that dough)
You know I'm saying (you know I'm saying)

Pissing off the towns folk
Jack Horner on the corner
Whistling that zoobie smoke
Cracked vessels like to wrestle
Like to make that bully choke
They’re the mortar I’m the pestle
I’m invested in that smoke
Buzz and Woody with that dope
Rum and hoodies hold the coke
Got them goodies in my coat
Know I shouldn’t so I won’t
Dumb ideas
Talk to my bro
Quick toke
It’s cold in here
From all the snow
I roll it quick I’m on the go
I need it slow I know you know
I need that sun to help me grow
I use the crow to help me glow
You call me a ufo
Cos I just learnt to make it home
That’s why I want you for my own
That’s why I keep you home alone

I step through
Like i’m next to, just blow up
Like i’m meant to, i’m not one

Then i’ll hex you

Fuck the rest too, i’m all good ima blessed dude

Yes sir, today

(I'm here to stay)
I'm sad that giant plupple passed away!
(R-I-P Moofus!)

In all our lives we go through darkness
For example I was hypnotized
For many, many years
And I'm frankly not too happy about it

But soon my troubles passed me by, by, by!
And I'm a bird and I am feathery
And this bird is feeling ready to take it to the sky!

I, I wonder why
Those plupples made a king of
Such a simple guy

You think they'd want a ruler
Maybe saner and a little cooler
Than a cracked egg with two vacant eyes!
Okay!

Your tasty friends will take care of the rest

So it was rad
And now it's firmly in the past
Now I'm ready to fly the coop

Oh shoot!

It's been a hoot!

Wish I could hang
But oh gosh dang
I gotta scoot!
I think I'll grab a ride
With a holographic corn
Right by my side

[Verse 1]
It's the human soundwave, straight out your comic book
Sound effects blazin through your rhymin' book
Just imagine, all the time it took, for me to master this
The Art of Noise is hazzardous
Imagine this, every sound from my lips
At my fingertips I levitate the audience
So ask Brooks and Dres who's got the effects
More dark than Mardi Gras, rugged like Gortex
Reach out and touch your whole crew like Nynex
Sprint for the stage cause MC onyx
Flip more connects than your internet
Rhymes is on time, I'm always on-line
Pump this in your Lex coupe, Benz, or Pathfind
Reverse the third verse nigga, then press rewind
[Hook:]
Make the music with your mouth (Rah-Razhel)
Make the music with your mouth (Rah-Rahzel)
Make the music with your mouth (Rah-Rahzel)
You make the music with your mouth
The music with your mouth

[Verse 2]
Yo yo, I'm takin the world by storm when I perform
Arm arm, leg-a leg-a head, watch me transform
(Transforming noises) Decepticons!
Rainin' on your college ass, this goes on
I'm animated, never dorm-ant, so change the format
What I'm strong at, Mortal Kombat, so Cheech and Chong that
(Fighting noises) Heh, brother damn you!
Heh, seems you're pretty good with your kung fu!
Now where's my Yong Fu at, my glass of cognac?
Digital readout with a comsat, but I'm not that smart cat
Let's track back, slick wanna eat that, you want my feedback?
(Computer noises) Now let's delete that
Now repeat that, I'm takin' the streets back like I'm sweep back
Think you could beat that?
I'm bringin the heat back on the street track

(Scratching) Marley Marl bring the beat back!
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rahzel, call me Optimus Prime
Third verse, eight bars, ain't no stoppin this rhyme
I did this years ago, I guess I'm ahead of my time
Computerized, that's my mental design
(?) short of Euclid, I'm runnin through clicks with a few tricks
An accoustics, John Woo flicks on some new shit
Heh, all I wanted was some rice cakes!
Rahzel soundwave controllin' your whole tri-state

[Hook Shortened: Chin of Adidas]
I’m the Chintologist
Been calling this
I’m the Chintologist
I’m reppin’ me not Stressin’ G

[Verse 1: Chin of Adidas]
Alight, so give me a minute to just kick it old school
Cuz I was born in the New Age, but I still act like an old fool
I’m batty insane, I’m a complete nut-job
The style of Slim Shady but still not quite dawg
I’m not quite the same, I don’t use the same lingo
But I light up the night just like the Bat Symbol
Striking the fear of God, better run to your temple
Wordplay and rhyming, to me, it’s just so simple
I don’t know who you think that you really are
But I know for a fact, that I am really far
Ahead of the competition, the antidote is my mission
If you feel the tides shiftin’, then my anecdote’s missin’
I’m mastering my Kraft like it’s Mac ’n’ Cheese
I’m splattering hijack, call me Master Chief
I played a lot of games, but that ain’t earn me respect
I decided to put in work, so myself I could protect
No more walking over me I gotta stand out
No more talking quietly, stand up and shout
[Pre-Hook: Chin of Adidas]
I’m gonna minor in beats
And major in rapping
I’m a monster I’m a beast
Chintology is happening

[Hook Full: Chin of Adidas]
I’m the Chintologist
(Ah, Uh-huh, Yeah!)
I’m the Chintologist
(Yes, I, Am, C’mon)
I’m the Chintologist
Been calling this
(There’s only one me and I’m the best)
I’m the Chintologist
I’m reppin’ me not Stressin’ G

[Verse 2: Chin of Adidas]
Class is in session, first lesson in anatomy
Cuz I have a history of girls being bad to me
She put me on her mental but it isn’t sentimental
I was deep in her frontal but it was all subliminal
It’s the grim reality of physicality
Psyching up the brain and escaping normality
It’s not the same, and it’ll never be
But I’m not to blame, this was never me
Second lesson is talking, you don’t have to stalk me
I’m a faithful guy, I put aside my pride
I do right by your side, but I’m too proud to hide
I like to be loud, I like to be alive
Third lesson is trust because without it you’re just
You’re just another person that’s feeding their lust
I’m lookin’ for what’s real not lookin’ for some fake
But this is how I feel, I didn’t want this to break
But it all fell apart, yes, it tumbled to the ground
You broke my heart now I’m crumbled on the ground
This isn’t that bad it’s not as bad as it sounds
I’m actually happy without you because you were so selfish
But I gotta put in emotion, so that I can sell this
I gotta be devoted because you were straight up hellish
When my friends ask, how am I going to tell this?
I guess I’ll be straight up, so I don’t seem so helpless
[Hook: Full Chin of Adidas]
I’m the Chintologist

[Verse 3: Chin of Adidas]
Honor Grad status from the school of Hard Knocks
I was not the baddest rather go and buy socks
I’d rather be happy than be manically depressed
I’d rather let you slap me than be cursed with terrets
I’d rather be me, I don’t wanne be you
We should all be ourselves, wouldn’t that be cool?
We could branch out in our own kind of way
That’s all that stands out at the end of the day
We are us, we’re not someone else
We’re not stupid, but being smart helps
Learn what you can that’s all you really need
Gimme 12 bars to get you up to speed
The world around us changes, it still continues to grow
Old friends become someone that you used to know
You can’t save em all, but you should save who you can
We can all learn to ball in the world’s master plan
Chintology 101 is a very simple lesson
We should all give more instead of less man

Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalalala

Hey hello, my jinglebells are gone
If you ever find them, you should leave them hanging on
Hey hello, I need my bells today
'Cause if we can find them we can jingle all the way

This is the moment to decorate the tree
Tomorrow we are celebrating christmas eve
I found the candles, right next to the star
But my bells are missing, can you show me where they are?

Train Of Dreams,pop,Eclipse Hunter,2009,46,{},"I had a nightmare where the wars had started
People were so alone and brokenhearted
Then it was gone as I opened my eyes
In the middle of the darkest night
No one beside me, fear was tearing apart
As I heard some beast’s bark
Later that night I heard a woman screaming…
Was it reality or were I dreaming?
Second by second I was trying to escape
But I just couldn’t break those chains
Chains of nightmares, terrorizing my mind
Then I saw a bright light…
Train of dreams, it’s the train of dreams
That is changing dreams like channels on TV
But it’s your fantasies, it’s your train of dreams
Where the things you see are not for real
Words that I heard at first seemed like noises
Strange, but so true, I heard the human voices!
Voices were coming thru the light that I saw
Nightmares were under its control

Philly Blunt Cypher 4,rap,The Palmer Squares,2011,1436,{},"[Verse 1: Acumental]
Back once again with a verse for the blunt cyph
Two emcees, one love, one life
Clever spittin' flames
And that's never gonna change
In the game 'til they diggin' up our skeletal remains
I'm awfully charming
You're softer than Charmin
Turn off the alarm and
Take a walk through the garden
The minds of Term and I were designed to merge together
We direct the energy, no need to buy a surge protector
Call me Forrest, I got wit by the acre
A walking thesaurus man I spit what ya favor
Ac stay lit like the saber that cut Luke
Always down to chug a 5th of Jager and bust loose
We take it from fishbowl to the Shed Aquarium
The best stepping out like Fred Astaire 'n them
These ordinary dogs ain't never seen the veterinarian
So if you got bones to pick, you'd better bury 'em
[Verse 2: Terminal Knowledge]
They've gone and turned the promise land into a shopping mall
What happens when they drop the ball and the profits fall?
From graffiti on Chicago walls to the patterns at the Taj Mahal
We got it all, what's taken is took
The brains and the looks
We stay in them books
Creatin' a hook then writin' a verse
I'll leave a legacy of heavily hittin' cleverly written raps
When I take my ride in a hearse
But rewind and reverse, I'm still in my youth
No matter how pearly the gates
It's a world full of hate, and I'll fill it with truth
Honestly modesty's gotta be the key to prophecy camaraderie
A prodigy stompin' emcees when he climbs on the track
I got some lucky balls like the lottery
It's not the mind that you got it's the spine that you lack
On some insane shit, acid rain shit, some cats remain stiff
When its time to react
I could jump a car with no cables
Use my mind to turn tables and the vinyl we scratch
I be a star like them binary cats
Press stop if your chest drops or simply if you findin' us wack

[Outro]
Me and Seth are blowing up like the Death Star
Rugrats be diggin' my shit, call me Reptar
Rep The Palmer Squares, better respect all that we do
Spittin' that raw shit for you!

Now she's walking like a whore

I lower my head, and she gives me a smile
She tells me I'm looking real good
I wish I could burn her like firewood

Well, I've been drinking my life away
Romanticizing yesterday
Well, everything improves with age
Except the girls I used to know
They cling to the past in desperation
Desolation girls
Well, me? I've given up on love
And trying to change the world

[VERSE 1]

Still Zenned
I ain't never had change
I rap and trap
Just to show you my range
My niggah it's strange
They thought I was nicholas
No I will not be in cages
But I'll on stages
I might disappear for some time
But I'm just tryna master my craft
And I'm tryna go hot Degrees
While I get degrees
And then orchestrate
With no stres
Just steeze

And you might compete
But y'all ain't like me
And you compliment
But you don't like me
I will not accept defeat
Until dementia
Has me going crazy
Did I mention
Insane in the membrane
Just to keep sanе
All these niggahs tryna play with Huey
Told thеm keep praying
Been saying
Niggahs keep hating
When you keep slaying
Off with your head
John Snow
But I keep playing
In the membrane
Keep saying
Gotta keep sane
Just to keep saying
Been sane
What I've been saying
Going Super Saijn
Skip days when my mood sways
O.G but I go G
Like I'm Max Payne

[VERSE 2]

Woah Woah
How a niggah do that?
All I do is big faxxx
And these niggahs big cap
Kizza cap
And i ain't really with that
Literally
Little niggah
Is whack
Personally
How they taking my raps
And these niggahs get touched
When I'm spitting these faxxx
Didn't wanna do it
But these niggahs had to doubt me
So I'm going automatic
When I'm aiming at the rival
Niggahs said I couldn't do it
And I just didn't believe
Someone had to be wrong
Man it couldn't be me
[VERSE 3]

Take a pause
And then make deposits
Then purple haze
Have a niggah awesome
I must be Austin
I got the Powers
When ZENN drops
It's September showers
And the movie of huey
Don't need auditions
Cause I'm really that niggah
Ain't no rendition
You divide all your problems
Attracting stress
And multiply by the Henny
With no addition

And I'm sad boy highs
With trap boy vibes
I pull up unexpected
Like an aerial high
I got A.S.A.P FERG level confidence
The note pad is my confidant
[Preskribed]
I've never liked the sky
It was as if people sat there
To watch a blank canvas
Never understoood The colors
Cascading into the next
With the occasional cloud

But

[PART 2]
[VERSE 4]

I had to switch on niggahs
Cause i wasn't tryna get predictable
And I know if I settled for 9-5
Then my niggah I might just die miserable
If the rap game stays the same
I might college dropout and go insane
But that's not even up for debate
My entire existence
Is saving the whole human race
Nigga this isn't a race
Top two
But I'm not two
And I don't like clone who's who

Clear to see
Is clarity
I pave Elaine
And have 'em asking who is he?

Real dust
How a niggah from the dirt
Been there, done that, got the shirt
Cascade
Flowers bloom in a dark room
And nowadays
I ain't singing to the right tune
Dark shades
Big rims
And jewellery
And Mr. SRCH. huey
Man
All of this new to me 
(huh)
Yuh, all of this new to me 
And Mr. SRCH. huey
Man
All of this new to me yuh

[Preskribed]
The sky seems to be painted with your smile
And the words ''I Love You''
Tattooed to my eyelids
Cause that's all I see
That's all I know
When you do as little
As to breath around me
You make my heart beat

I find out that there is space
For a passion spent in the depths
Of thought and silky smooth reoccurrences that come over me
Like the sound of your voice on a Monday morning
Or a Tuesday afternoon
Maybe on a anytime, everyday
There aren't enough pages to express
All the words you make me want to say

But wait I was talking about the sky
The sky, envies me
Because all it can do is hover above 
When I'm right next to you feeling this love
I hope your yesterday remembers me tomorrow
All the pain and pounds of sorrow
I hope it all disappears
I hope the sun misses the moon
I hope this love doesn't leave too soon
I pray this song is left on loop, so I can relive our moments
Over and over and over
Over and over and over

One Day Shell Love Me,pop,Sting,2000,388,"{""Shawn Colvin""}","[STING]
I'd never imagined before
That the world could be turned on its head
I'd never have thought
To be here in this place

I'd never have dreamt that in love
I'd be lost and so easily led
I guess I was caught
By that hint of a smile on her face

I thought I was happy before
When my life was as easy as pie
But that was the past of an ignorant youth

I'm falling in love with the girl
But I'm forced to be living a lie
And she'd never love me
If she knew the truth
Is it asking too much
If I pray for a miracle, miracle?
One day she'll love me
One day she'll say ""I care""

[SHAWN COLVIN]
Although he's changing day by day
He finds these tender words of love
Impossible to say

He walks in the room
And I'm never quite sure
If he's trying to be somebody else
I'm liking him better that he's
Not his arrogant self
Perhaps I'm expecting too much
Of a miracle, miracle

One day he'll love me
One day he'll say ""I love you""
And I will love him until I die

[STING]
Distant star
Cast your light
On my life
And one by one
[SHAWN COLVIN & STING & BOTH]
I didn't anticipate feeling the power of love
In this way
And day by day
We've never been closer than this
And I find myself daring to pray
We'll find these tender ways of love
Impossible to disobey

One day she'll love me
One day he'll say ""I love you""
And I will love her

The Poet,misc,Ralph Waldo Emerson,2013,1655,{},"     A moody child and wildly wise
     Pursued the game with joyful eyes,
     Which chose, like meteors, their way,
     And rived the dark with private ray:
     They overleapt the horizon's edge,
     Searched with Apollo's privilege;
     Through man, and woman, and sea, and star,
     Saw the dance of nature forward far;
     Through worlds, and races, and terms, and times,
     Saw musical order, and pairing rhymes.

ESSAY I The Poet

Those who are esteemed umpires of taste, are often persons who have acquired some knowledge of admired pictures or sculptures, and have an inclination for whatever is elegant; but if you inquire whether they are beautiful souls, and whether their own acts are like fair pictures, you learn that they are selfish and sensual. Their cultivation is local, as if you should rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce fire, all the rest remaining cold. Their knowledge of the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars, or some limited judgment of color or form, which is exercised for amusement or for show. It is a proof of the shallowness of the doctrine of beauty, as it lies in the minds of our amateurs, that men seem to have lost the perception of the instant dependence of form upon soul. There is no doctrine of forms in our philosophy. We were put into our bodies, as fire is put into a pan, to be carried about; but there is no accurate adjustment between the spirit and the organ, much less is the latter the germination of the former. So in regard to other forms, the intellectual men do not believe in any essential dependence of the material world on thought and volition. Theologians think it a pretty air-castle to talk of the spiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud, of a city or a contract, but they prefer to come again to the solid ground of historical evidence; and even the poets are contented with a civil and conformed manner of living, and to write poems from the fancy, at a safe distance from their own experience. But the highest minds of the world have never ceased to explore the double meaning, or, shall I say, the quadruple, or the centuple, or much more manifold meaning, of every sensuous fact: Orpheus, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Plato, Plutarch, Dante, Swedenborg, and the masters of sculpture, picture, and poetry. For we are not pans and barrows, nor even porters of the fire and torch-bearers, but children of the fire, made of it, and only the same divinity transmuted, and at two or three removes, when we know least about it. And this hidden truth, that the fountains whence all this river of Time, and its creatures, floweth, are intrinsically ideal and beautiful, draws us to the consideration of the nature and functions of the Poet, or the man of Beauty, to the means and materials he uses, and to the general aspect of the art in the present time.

The breadth of the problem is great, for the poet is representative. He stands among partial men for the complete man, and apprises us not of his wealth, but of the common-wealth. The young man reveres men of genius, because, to speak truly, they are more himself than he is. They receive of the soul as he also receives, but they more. Nature enhances her beauty, to the eye of loving men, from their belief that the poet is beholding her shows at the same time. He is isolated among his contemporaries, by truth and by his art, but with this consolation in his pursuits, that they will draw all men sooner or later. For all men live by truth, and stand in need of expression. In love, in art, in avarice, in politics, in labor, in games, we study to utter our painful secret. The man is only half himself, the other half is his expression.
Notwithstanding this necessity to be published, adequate expression is rare. I know not how it is that we need an interpreter; but the great majority of men seem to be minors, who have not yet come into possession of their own, or mutes, who cannot report the conversation they have had with nature. There is no man who does not anticipate a supersensual utility in the sun, and stars, earth, and water. These stand and wait to render him a peculiar service. But there is some obstruction, or some excess of phlegm in our constitution, which does not suffer them to yield the due effect. Too feeble fall the impressions of nature on us to make us artists. Every touch should thrill. Every man should be so much an artist, that he could report in conversation what had befallen him. Yet, in our experience, the rays or appulses have sufficient force to arrive at the senses, but not enough to reach the quick, and compel the reproduction of themselves in speech. The poet is the person in whom these powers are in balance, the man without impediment, who sees and handles that which others dream of, traverses the whole scale of experience, and is representative of man, in virtue of being the largest power to receive and to impart.

For the Universe has three children, born at one time, which reappear, under different names, in every system of thought, whether they be called cause, operation, and effect; or, more poetically, Jove, Pluto, Neptune; or, theologically, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son; but which we will call here, the Knower, the Doer, and the Sayer. These stand respectively for the love of truth, for the love of good, and for the love of beauty. These three are equal. Each is that which he is essentially, so that he cannot be surmounted or analyzed, and each of these three has the power of the others latent in him, and his own patent.

The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty. He is a sovereign, and stands on the centre. For the world is not painted, or adorned, but is from the beginning beautiful; and God has not made some beautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the universe. Therefore the poet is not any permissive potentate, but is emperor in his own right. Criticism is infested with a can't of materialism, which assumes that manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men, and disparages such as say and do not, overlooking the fact, that some men, namely, poets, are natural sayers, sent into the world to the end of expression, and confounds them with those whose province is action, but who quit it to imitate the sayers. But Homer's words are as costly and admirable to Homer, as Agamemnon's victories are to Agamemnon. The poet does not wait for the hero or the sage, but, as they act and think primarily, so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken, reckoning the others, though primaries also, yet, in respect to him, secondaries and servants; as sitters or models in the studio of a painter, or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect.

For poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music, we hear those primal warblings, and attempt to write them down, but we lose ever and anon a word, or a verse, and substitute something of our own, and thus miswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear write down these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs of the nations. For nature is as truly beautiful as it is good, or as it is reasonable, and must as much appear, as it must be done, or be known. Words and deeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy. Words are also actions, and actions are a kind of words.

The sign and credentials of the poet are, that he announces that which no man foretold. He is the true and only doctor; he knows and tells; he is the only teller of news, for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes. He is a beholder of ideas, and an utterer of the necessary and causal. For we do not speak now of men of poetical talents, or of industry and skill in metre, but of the true poet. I took part in a conversation the other day, concerning a recent writer of lyrics, a man of subtle mind, whose head appeared to be a music-box of delicate tunes and rhythms, and whose skill, and command of language, we could not sufficiently praise. But when the question arose, whether he was not only a lyrist, but a poet, we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary, not an eternal man. He does not stand out of our low limitations, like a Chimborazo under the line, running up from the torrid base through all the climates of the globe, with belts of the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides; but this genius is the landscape-garden of a modern house, adorned with fountains and statues, with well-bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks and terraces. We hear, through all the varied music, the ground-tone of conventional life. Our poets are men of talents who sing, and not the children of music. The argument is secondary, the finish of the verses is primary.

For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument, that makes a poem, — a thought so passionate and alive, that, like the spirit of a plant or an animal, it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing. The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form. The poet has a new thought: he has a whole new experience to unfold; he will tell us how it was with him, and all men will be the richer in his fortune. For, the experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world seems always waiting for its poet. I remember, when I was young, how much I was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at table. He had left his work, and gone rambling none knew whither, and had written hundreds of lines, but could not tell whether that which was in him was therein told: he could tell nothing but that all was changed, — man, beast, heaven, earth, and sea. How gladly we listened! how credulous! Society seemed to be compromised. We sat in the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars. Boston seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before, or was much farther than that. Rome, — what was Rome? Plutarch and Shakspeare were in the yellow leaf, and Homer no more should be heard of. It is much to know that poetry has been written this very day, under this very roof, by your side. What! that wonderful spirit has not expired! these stony moments are still sparkling and animated! I had fancied that the oracles were all silent, and nature had spent her fires, and behold! all night, from every pore, these fine auroras have been streaming. Every one has some interest in the advent of the poet, and no one knows how much it may concern him. We know that the secret of the world is profound, but who or what shall be our interpreter, we know not. A mountain ramble, a new style of face, a new person, may put the key into our hands. Of course, the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report. Talent may frolic and juggle; genius realizes and adds. Mankind, in good earnest, have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work, that the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news. It is the truest word ever spoken, and the phrase will be the fittest, most musical, and the unerring voice of the world for that time.

All that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is the principal event in chronology. Man, never so often deceived, still watches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth, until he has made it his own. With what joy I begin to read a poem, which I confide in as an inspiration! And now my chains are to be broken; I shall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in which I live, — opaque, though they seem transparent, — and from the heaven of truth I shall see and comprehend my relations. That will reconcile me to life, and renovate nature, to see trifles animated by a tendency, and to know what I am doing. Life will no more be a noise; now I shall see men and women, and know the signs by which they may be discerned from fools and satans. This day shall be better than my birth-day: then I became an animal: now I am invited into the science of the real. Such is the hope, but the fruition is postponed. Oftener it falls, that this winged man, who will carry me into the heaven, whirls me into the clouds, then leaps and frisks about with me from cloud to cloud, still affirming that he is bound heavenward; and I, being myself a novice, am slow in perceiving that he does not know the way into the heavens, and is merely bent that I should admire his skill to rise, like a fowl or a flying fish, a little way from the ground or the water; but the all-piercing, all-feeding, and ocular air of heaven, that man shall never inhabit. I tumble down again soon into my old nooks, and lead the life of exaggerations as before, and have lost my faith in the possibility of any guide who can lead me thither where I would be.

But leaving these victims of vanity, let us, with new hope, observe how nature, by worthier impulses, has ensured the poet's fidelity to his office of announcement and affirming, namely, by the beauty of things, which becomes a new, and higher beauty, when expressed. Nature offers all her creatures to him as a picture-language. Being used as a type, a second wonderful value appears in the object, far better than its old value, as the carpenter's stretched cord, if you hold your ear close enough, is musical in the breeze. ""Things more excellent than every image,"" says Jamblichus, ""are expressed through images."" Things admit of being used as symbols, because nature is a symbol, in the whole, and in every part. Every line we can draw in the sand, has expression; and there is no body without its spirit or genius. All form is an effect of character; all condition, of the quality of the life; all harmony, of health; (and, for this reason, a perception of beauty should be sympathetic, or proper only to the good.) The beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary. The soul makes the body, as the wise Spenser teaches: —""So every spirit, as it is most pure,
And hath in it the more of heavenly light,
So it the fairer body doth procure
To habit in, and it more fairly dight,
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.
For, of the soul, the body form doth take,
For soul is form, and doth the body make.""Here we find ourselves, suddenly, not in a critical speculation, but in a holy place, and should go very warily and reverently. We stand before the secret of the world, there where Being passes into Appearance, and Unity into Variety.

The Universe is the externisation of the soul. Wherever the life is, that bursts into appearance around it. Our science is sensual, and therefore superficial. The earth, and the heavenly bodies, physics, and chemistry, we sensually treat, as if they were self-existent; but these are the retinue of that Being we have. ""The mighty heaven,"" said Proclus, ""exhibits, in its transfigurations, clear images of the splendor of intellectual perceptions; being moved in conjunction with the unapparent periods of intellectual natures."" Therefore, science always goes abreast with the just elevation of the man, keeping step with religion and metaphysics; or, the state of science is an index of our self-knowledge. Since everything in nature answers to a moral power, if any phenomenon remains brute and dark, it is that the corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet active.

No wonder, then, if these waters be so deep, that we hover over them with a religious regard. The beauty of the fable proves the importance of the sense; to the poet, and to all others; or, if you please, every man is so far a poet as to be susceptible of these enchantments of nature: for all men have the thoughts whereof the universe is the celebration. I find that the fascination resides in the symbol. Who loves nature? Who does not? Is it only poets, and men of leisure and cultivation, who live with her? No; but also hunters, farmers, grooms, and butchers, though they express their affection in their choice of life, and not in their choice of words. The writer wonders what the coachman or the hunter values in riding, in horses, and dogs. It is not superficial qualities. When you talk with him, he holds these at as slight a rate as you. His worship is sympathetic; he has no definitions, but he is commanded in nature, by the living power which he feels to be there present. No imitation, or playing of these things, would content him; he loves the earnest of the northwind, of rain, of stone, and wood, and iron. A beauty not explicable, is dearer than a beauty which we can see to the end of. It is nature the symbol, nature certifying the supernatural, body overflowed by life, which he worships, with coarse, but sincere rites.
The inwardness, and mystery, of this attachment, drives men of every class to the use of emblems. The schools of poets, and philosophers, are not more intoxicated with their symbols, than the populace with theirs. In our political parties, compute the power of badges and emblems. See the great ball which they roll from Baltimore to Bunker hill! In the political processions, Lowell goes in a loom, and Lynn in a shoe, and Salem in a ship. Witness the cider-barrel, the log-cabin, the hickory-stick, the palmetto, and all the cognizances of party. See the power of national emblems. Some stars, lilies, leopards, a crescent, a lion, an eagle, or other figure, which came into credit God knows how, on an old rag of bunting, blowing in the wind, on a fort, at the ends of the earth, shall make the blood tingle under the rudest, or the most conventional exterior. The people fancy they hate poetry, and they are all poets and mystics!

Beyond this universality of the symbolic language, we are apprised of the divineness of this superior use of things, whereby the world is a temple, whose walls are covered with emblems, pictures, and commandments of the Deity, in this, that there is no fact in nature which does not carry the whole sense of nature; and the distinctions which we make in events, and in affairs, of low and high, honest and base, disappear when nature is used as a symbol. Thought makes every thing fit for use. The vocabulary of an omniscient man would embrace words and images excluded from polite conversation. What would be base, or even obscene, to the obscene, becomes illustrious, spoken in a new connexion of thought. The piety of the Hebrew prophets purges their grossness. The circumcision is an example of the power of poetry to raise the low and offensive. Small and mean things serve as well as great symbols. The meaner the type by which a law is expressed, the more pungent it is, and the more lasting in the memories of men: just as we choose the smallest box, or case, in which any needful utensil can be carried. Bare lists of words are found suggestive, to an imaginative and excited mind; as it is related of Lord Chatham, that he was accustomed to read in Bailey's Dictionary, when he was preparing to speak in Parliament. The poorest experience is rich enough for all the purposes of expressing thought. Why covet a knowledge of new facts? Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles. We are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use. We can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity. It does not need that a poem should be long. Every word was once a poem. Every new relation is a new word. Also, we use defects and deformities to a sacred purpose, so expressing our sense that the evils of the world are such only to the evil eye. In the old mythology, mythologists observe, defects are ascribed to divine natures, as lameness to Vulcan, blindness to Cupid, and the like, to signify exuberances.

For, as it is dislocation and detachment from the life of God, that makes things ugly, the poet, who re-attaches things to nature and the Whole, — re-attaching even artificial things, and violations of nature, to nature, by a deeper insight, — disposes very easily of the most disagreeable facts. Readers of poetry see the factory-village, and the railway, and fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken up by these; for these works of art are not yet consecrated in their reading; but the poet sees them fall within the great Order not less than the beehive, or the spider's geometrical web. Nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles, and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own. Besides, in a centred mind, it signifies nothing how many mechanical inventions you exhibit. Though you add millions, and never so surprising, the fact of mechanics has not gained a grain's weight. The spiritual fact remains unalterable, by many or by few particulars; as no mountain is of any appreciable height to break the curve of the sphere. A shrewd country-boy goes to the city for the first time, and the complacent citizen is not satisfied with his little wonder. It is not that he does not see all the fine houses, and know that he never saw such before, but he disposes of them as easily as the poet finds place for the railway. The chief value of the new fact, is to enhance the great and constant fact of Life, which can dwarf any and every circumstance, and to which the belt of wampum, and the commerce of America, are alike.

The world being thus put under the mind for verb and noun, the poet is he who can articulate it. For, though life is great, and fascinates, and absorbs, — and though all men are intelligent of the symbols through which it is named, — yet they cannot originally use them. We are symbols, and inhabit symbols; workman, work, and tools, words and things, birth and death, all are emblems; but we sympathize with the symbols, and, being infatuated with the economical uses of things, we do not know that they are thoughts. The poet, by an ulterior intellectual perception, gives them a power which makes their old use forgotten, and puts eyes, and a tongue, into every dumb and inanimate object. He perceives the independence of the thought on the symbol, the stability of the thought, the accidency and fugacity of the symbol. As the eyes of Lyncaeus were said to see through the earth, so the poet turns the world to glass, and shows us all things in their right series and procession. For, through that better perception, he stands one step nearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis; perceives that thought is multiform; that within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form; and, following with his eyes the life, uses the forms which express that life, and so his speech flows with the flowing of nature. All the facts of the animal economy, sex, nutriment, gestation, birth, growth, are symbols of the passage of the world into the soul of man, to suffer there a change, and reappear a new and higher fact. He uses forms according to the life, and not according to the form. This is true science. The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation, and animation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs them as signs. He knows why the plain, or meadow of space, was strewn with these flowers we call suns, and moons, and stars; why the great deep is adorned with animals, with men, and gods; for, in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought.

By virtue of this science the poet is the Namer, or Language-maker, naming things sometimes after their appearance, sometimes after their essence, and giving to every one its own name and not another's, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which delights in detachment or boundary. The poets made all the words, and therefore language is the archives of history, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses. For, though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency, because for the moment it symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer. The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture. Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made up of images, or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin. But the poet names the thing because he sees it, or comes one step nearer to it than any other. This expression, or naming, is not art, but a second nature, grown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree. What we call nature, is a certain self-regulated motion, or change; and nature does all things by her own hands, and does not leave another to baptise her, but baptises herself; and this through the metamorphosis again. I remember that a certain poet described it to me thus:

Genius is the activity which repairs the decays of things, whether wholly or partly of a material and finite kind. Nature, through all her kingdoms, insures herself. Nobody cares for planting the poor fungus: so she shakes down from the gills of one agaric countless spores, any one of which, being preserved, transmits new billions of spores to-morrow or next day. The new agaric of this hour has a chance which the old one had not. This atom of seed is thrown into a new place, not subject to the accidents which destroyed its parent two rods off. She makes a man; and having brought him to ripe age, she will no longer run the risk of losing this wonder at a blow, but she detaches from him a new self, that the kind may be safe from accidents to which the individual is exposed. So when the soul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought, she detaches and sends away from it its poems or songs, — a fearless, sleepless, deathless progeny, which is not exposed to the accidents of the weary kingdom of time: a fearless, vivacious offspring, clad with wings (such was the virtue of the soul out of which they came), which carry them fast and far, and infix them irrecoverably into the hearts of men. These wings are the beauty of the poet's soul. The songs, thus flying immortal from their mortal parent, are pursued by clamorous flights of censures, which swarm in far greater numbers, and threaten to devour them; but these last are not winged. At the end of a very short leap they fall plump down, and rot, having received from the souls out of which they came no beautiful wings. But the melodies of the poet ascend, and leap, and pierce into the deeps of infinite time.

So far the bard taught me, using his freer speech. But nature has a higher end, in the production of new individuals, than security, namely, ascension, or, the passage of the soul into higher forms. I knew, in my younger days, the sculptor who made the statue of the youth which stands in the public garden. He was, as I remember, unable to tell directly, what made him happy, or unhappy, but by wonderful indirections he could tell. He rose one day, according to his habit, before the dawn, and saw the morning break, grand as the eternity out of which it came, and, for many days after, he strove to express this tranquillity, and, lo! his chisel had fashioned out of marble the form of a beautiful youth, Phosphorus, whose aspect is such, that, it is said, all persons who look on it become silent. The poet also resigns himself to his mood, and that thought which agitated him is expressed, but alter idem, in a manner totally new. The expression is organic, or, the new type which things themselves take when liberated. As, in the sun, objects paint their images on the retina of the eye, so they, sharing the aspiration of the whole universe, tend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence in his mind. Like the metamorphosis of things into higher organic forms, is their change into melodies. Over everything stands its daemon, or soul, and, as the form of the thing is reflected by the eye, so the soul of the thing is reflected by a melody. The sea, the mountain-ridge, Niagara, and every flower-bed, pre-exist, or super-exist, in pre-cantations, which sail like odors in the air, and when any man goes by with an ear sufficiently fine, he overhears them, and endeavors to write down the notes, without diluting or depraving them. And herein is the legitimation of criticism, in the mind's faith, that the poems are a corrupt version of some text in nature, with which they ought to be made to tally. A rhyme in one of our sonnets should not be less pleasing than the iterated nodes of a sea-shell, or the resembling difference of a group of flowers. The pairing of the birds is an idyl, not tedious as our idyls are; a tempest is a rough ode, without falsehood or rant: a summer, with its harvest sown, reaped, and stored, is an epic song, subordinating how many admirably executed parts. Why should not the symmetry and truth that modulate these, glide into our spirits, and we participate the invention of nature?

This insight, which expresses itself by what is called Imagination, is a very high sort of seeing, which does not come by study, but by the intellect being where and what it sees, by sharing the path, or circuit of things through forms, and so making them translucid to others. The path of things is silent. Will they suffer a speaker to go with them? A spy they will not suffer; a lover, a poet, is the transcendency of their own nature, — him they will suffer. The condition of true naming, on the poet's part, is his resigning himself to the divine aura which breathes through forms, and accompanying that.

It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns, that, beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious intellect, he is capable of a new energy (as of an intellect doubled on itself), by abandonment to the nature of things; that, beside his privacy of power as an individual man, there is a great public power, on which he can draw, by unlocking, at all risks, his human doors, and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him: then he is caught up into the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder, his thought is law, and his words are universally intelligible as the plants and animals. The poet knows that he speaks adequately, then, only when he speaks somewhat wildly, or, ""with the flower of the mind;"" not with the intellect, used as an organ, but with the intellect released from all service, and suffered to take its direction from its celestial life; or, as the ancients were won't to express themselves, not with intellect alone, but with the intellect inebriated by nectar. As the traveller who has lost his way, throws his reins on his horse's neck, and trusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do with the divine animal who carries us through this world. For if in any manner we can stimulate this instinct, new passages are opened for us into nature, the mind flows into and through things hardest and highest, and the metamorphosis is possible.

This is the reason why bards love wine, mead, narcotics, coffee, tea, opium, the fumes of sandal-wood and tobacco, or whatever other species of animal exhilaration. All men avail themselves of such means as they can, to add this extraordinary power to their normal powers; and to this end they prize conversation, music, pictures, sculpture, dancing, theatres, travelling, war, mobs, fires, gaming, politics, or love, or science, or animal intoxication, which are several coarser or finer quasi-mechanical substitutes for the true nectar, which is the ravishment of the intellect by coming nearer to the fact. These are auxiliaries to the centrifugal tendency of a man, to his passage out into free space, and they help him to escape the custody of that body in which he is pent up, and of that jail-yard of individual relations in which he is enclosed. Hence a great number of such as were professionally expressors of Beauty, as painters, poets, musicians, and actors, have been more than others won't to lead a life of pleasure and indulgence; all but the few who received the true nectar; and, as it was a spurious mode of attaining freedom, as it was an emancipation not into the heavens, but into the freedom of baser places, they were punished for that advantage they won, by a dissipation and deterioration. But never can any advantage be taken of nature by a trick. The spirit of the world, the great calm presence of the creator, comes not forth to the sorceries of opium or of wine. The sublime vision comes to the pure and simple soul in a clean and chaste body. That is not an inspiration which we owe to narcotics, but some counterfeit excitement and fury. Milton says, that the lyric poet may drink wine and live generously, but the epic poet, he who shall sing of the gods, and their descent unto men, must drink water out of a wooden bowl. For poetry is not 'Devil's wine,' but God's wine. It is with this as it is with toys. We fill the hands and nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls, drums, and horses, withdrawing their eyes from the plain face and sufficing objects of nature, the sun, and moon, the animals, the water, and stones, which should be their toys. So the poet's habit of living should be set on a key so low and plain, that the common influences should delight him. His cheerfulness should be the gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice for his inspiration, and he should be tipsy with water. That spirit which suffices quiet hearts, which seems to come forth to such from every dry knoll of sere grass, from every pine-stump, and half-imbedded stone, on which the dull March sun shines, comes forth to the poor and hungry, and such as are of simple taste. If thou fill thy brain with Boston and New York, with fashion and covetousness, and wilt stimulate thy jaded senses with wine and French coffee, thou shalt find no radiance of wisdom in the lonely waste of the pinewoods.

If the imagination intoxicates the poet, it is not inactive in other men. The metamorphosis excites in the beholder an emotion of joy. The use of symbols has a certain power of emancipation and exhilaration for all men. We seem to be touched by a wand, which makes us dance and run about happily, like children. We are like persons who come out of a cave or cellar into the open air. This is the effect on us of tropes, fables, oracles, and all poetic forms. Poets are thus liberating gods. Men have really got a new sense, and found within their world, another world, or nest of worlds; for, the metamorphosis once seen, we divine that it does not stop. I will not now consider how much this makes the charm of algebra and the mathematics, which also have their tropes, but it is felt in every definition; as, when Aristotle defines space to be an immovable vessel, in which things are contained; — or, when Plato defines a line to be a flowing point; or, figure to be a bound of solid; and many the like. What a joyful sense of freedom we have, when Vitruvius announces the old opinion of artists, that no architect can build any house well, who does not know something of anatomy. When Socrates, in Charmides, tells us that the soul is cured of its maladies by certain incantations, and that these incantations are beautiful reasons, from which temperance is generated in souls; when Plato calls the world an animal; and Timaeus affirms that the plants also are animals; or affirms a man to be a heavenly tree, growing with his root, which is his head, upward; and, as George Chapman, following him, writes, —""So in our tree of man, whose nervie root
Springs in his top;""when Orpheus speaks of hoariness as ""that white flower which marks extreme old age;"" when Proclus calls the universe the statue of the intellect; when Chaucer, in his praise of 'Gentilesse,' compares good blood in mean condition to fire, which, though carried to the darkest house betwixt this and the mount of Caucasus, will yet hold its natural office, and burn as bright as if twenty thousand men did it behold; when John saw, in the apocalypse, the ruin of the world through evil, and the stars fall from heaven, as the figtree casteth her untimely fruit; when Aesop reports the whole catalogue of common daily relations through the masquerade of birds and beasts; — we take the cheerful hint of the immortality of our essence, and its versatile habit and escapes, as when the gypsies say, ""it is in vain to hang them, they cannot die.""

The poets are thus liberating gods. The ancient British bards had for the title of their order, ""Those who are free throughout the world."" They are free, and they make free. An imaginative book renders us much more service at first, by stimulating us through its tropes, than afterward, when we arrive at the precise sense of the author. I think nothing is of any value in books, excepting the transcendental and extraordinary. If a man is inflamed and carried away by his thought, to that degree that he forgets the authors and the public, and heeds only this one dream, which holds him like an insanity, let me read his paper, and you may have all the arguments and histories and criticism. All the value which attaches to Pythagoras, Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, Cardan, Kepler, Swedenborg, Schelling, Oken, or any other who introduces questionable facts into his cosmogony, as angels, devils, magic, astrology, palmistry, mesmerism, and so on, is the certificate we have of departure from routine, and that here is a new witness. That also is the best success in conversation, the magic of liberty, which puts the world, like a ball, in our hands. How cheap even the liberty then seems; how mean to study, when an emotion communicates to the intellect the power to sap and upheave nature: how great the perspective! nations, times, systems, enter and disappear, like threads in tapestry of large figure and many colors; dream delivers us to dream, and, while the drunkenness lasts, we will sell our bed, our philosophy, our religion, in our opulence.

There is good reason why we should prize this liberation. The fate of the poor shepherd, who, blinded and lost in the snow-storm, perishes in a drift within a few feet of his cottage door, is an emblem of the state of man. On the brink of the waters of life and truth, we are miserably dying. The inaccessibleness of every thought but that we are in, is wonderful. What if you come near to it, — you are as remote, when you are nearest, as when you are farthest. Every thought is also a prison; every heaven is also a prison. Therefore we love the poet, the inventor, who in any form, whether in an ode, or in an action, or in looks and behavior, has yielded us a new thought. He unlocks our chains, and admits us to a new scene.
This emancipation is dear to all men, and the power to impart it, as it must come from greater depth and scope of thought, is a measure of intellect. Therefore all books of the imagination endure, all which ascend to that truth, that the writer sees nature beneath him, and uses it as his exponent. Every verse or sentence, possessing this virtue, will take care of its own immortality. The religions of the world are the ejaculations of a few imaginative men.

But the quality of the imagination is to flow, and not to freeze. The poet did not stop at the color, or the form, but read their meaning; neither may he rest in this meaning, but he makes the same objects exponents of his new thought. Here is the difference betwixt the poet and the mystic, that the last nails a symbol to one sense, which was a true sense for a moment, but soon becomes old and false. For all symbols are fluxional; all language is vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries and horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and houses are, for homestead. Mysticism consists in the mistake of an accidental and individual symbol for an universal one. The morning-redness happens to be the favorite meteor to the eyes of Jacob Behmen, and comes to stand to him for truth and faith; and he believes should stand for the same realities to every reader. But the first reader prefers as naturally the symbol of a mother and child, or a gardener and his bulb, or a jeweller polishing a gem. Either of these, or of a myriad more, are equally good to the person to whom they are significant. Only they must be held lightly, and be very willingly translated into the equivalent terms which others use. And the mystic must be steadily told, — All that you say is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it. Let us have a little algebra, instead of this trite rhetoric, — universal signs, instead of these village symbols, — and we shall both be gainers. The history of hierarchies seems to show, that all religious error consisted in making the symbol too stark and solid, and, at last, nothing but an excess of the organ of language.

Swedenborg, of all men in the recent ages, stands eminently for the translator of nature into thought. I do not know the man in history to whom things stood so uniformly for words. Before him the metamorphosis continually plays. Everything on which his eye rests, obeys the impulses of moral nature. The figs become grapes whilst he eats them. When some of his angels affirmed a truth, the laurel twig which they held blossomed in their hands. The noise which, at a distance, appeared like gnashing and thumping, on coming nearer was found to be the voice of disputants. The men, in one of his visions, seen in heavenly light, appeared like dragons, and seemed in darkness: but, to each other, they appeared as men, and, when the light from heaven shone into their cabin, they complained of the darkness, and were compelled to shut the window that they might see.

There was this perception in him, which makes the poet or seer, an object of awe and terror, namely, that the same man, or society of men, may wear one aspect to themselves and their companions, and a different aspect to higher intelligences. Certain priests, whom he describes as conversing very learnedly together, appeared to the children, who were at some distance, like dead horses: and many the like misappearances. And instantly the mind inquires, whether these fishes under the bridge, yonder oxen in the pasture, those dogs in the yard, are immutably fishes, oxen, and dogs, or only so appear to me, and perchance to themselves appear upright men; and whether I appear as a man to all eyes. The Bramins and Pythagoras propounded the same question, and if any poet has witnessed the transformation, he doubtless found it in harmony with various experiences. We have all seen changes as considerable in wheat and caterpillars. He is the poet, and shall draw us with love and terror, who sees, through the flowing vest, the firm nature, and can declare it.

I look in vain for the poet whom I describe. We do not, with sufficient plainness, or sufficient profoundness, address ourselves to life, nor dare we chaunt our own times and social circumstance. If we filled the day with bravery, we should not shrink from celebrating it. Time and nature yield us many gifts, but not yet the timely man, the new religion, the reconciler, whom all things await. Dante's praise is, that he dared to write his autobiography in colossal cipher, or into universality. We have yet had no genius in America, with tyrannous eye, which knew the value of our incomparable materials, and saw, in the barbarism and materialism of the times, another carnival of the same gods whose picture he so much admires in Homer; then in the middle age; then in Calvinism. Banks and tariffs, the newspaper and caucus, methodism and unitarianism, are flat and dull to dull people, but rest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of Troy, and the temple of Delphos, and are as swiftly passing away. Our logrolling, our stumps and their politics, our fisheries, our Negroes, and Indians, our boasts, and our repudiations, the wrath of rogues, and the pusillanimity of honest men, the northern trade, the southern planting, the western clearing, Oregon, and Texas, are yet unsung. Yet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres. If I have not found that excellent combination of gifts in my countrymen which I seek, neither could I aid myself to fix the idea of the poet by reading now and then in Chalmers's collection of five centuries of English poets. These are wits, more than poets, though there have been poets among them. But when we adhere to the ideal of the poet, we have our difficulties even with Milton and Homer. Milton is too literary, and Homer too literal and historical.

But I am not wise enough for a national criticism, and must use the old largeness a little longer, to discharge my errand from the muse to the poet concerning his art.

Art is the path of the creator to his work. The paths, or methods, are ideal and eternal, though few men ever see them, not the artist himself for years, or for a lifetime, unless he come into the conditions. The painter, the sculptor, the composer, the epic rhapsodist, the orator, all partake one desire, namely, to express themselves symmetrically and abundantly, not dwarfishly and fragmentarily. They found or put themselves in certain conditions, as, the painter and sculptor before some impressive human figures; the orator, into the assembly of the people; and the others, in such scenes as each has found exciting to his intellect; and each presently feels the new desire. He hears a voice, he sees a beckoning. Then he is apprised, with wonder, what herds of daemons hem him in. He can no more rest; he says, with the old painter, ""By God, it is in me, and must go forth of me."" He pursues a beauty, half seen, which flies before him. The poet pours out verses in every solitude. Most of the things he says are conventional, no doubt; but by and by he says something which is original and beautiful. That charms him. He would say nothing else but such things. In our way of talking, we say, 'That is yours, this is mine;' but the poet knows well that it is not his; that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to you; he would fain hear the like eloquence at length. Once having tasted this immortal ichor, he cannot have enough of it, and, as an admirable creative power exists in these intellections, it is of the last importance that these things get spoken. What a little of all we know is said! What drops of all the sea of our science are baled up! and by what accident it is that these are exposed, when so many secrets sleep in nature! Hence the necessity of speech and song; hence these throbs and heart-beatings in the orator, at the door of the assembly, to the end, namely, that thought may be ejaculated as Logos, or Word.

Doubt not, O poet, but persist. Say, 'It is in me, and shall out.' Stand there, baulked and dumb, stuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand and strive, until, at last, rage draw out of thee that dream-power which every night shows thee is thine own; a power transcending all limit and privacy, and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity. Nothing walks, or creeps, or grows, or exists, which must not in turn arise and walk before him as exponent of his meaning. Comes he to that power, his genius is no longer exhaustible. All the creatures, by pairs and by tribes, pour into his mind as into a Noah's ark, to come forth again to people a new world. This is like the stock of air for our respiration, or for the combustion of our fireplace, not a measure of gallons, but the entire atmosphere if wanted. And therefore the rich poets, as Homer, Chaucer, Shakspeare, and Raphael, have obviously no limits to their works, except the limits of their lifetime, and resemble a mirror carried through the street, ready to render an image of every created thing.

O poet! a new nobility is conferred in groves and pastures, and not in castles, or by the sword-blade, any longer. The conditions are hard, but equal. Thou shalt leave the world, and know the muse only. Thou shalt not know any longer the times, customs, graces, politics, or opinions of men, but shalt take all from the muse. For the time of towns is tolled from the world by funereal chimes, but in nature the universal hours are counted by succeeding tribes of animals and plants, and by growth of joy on joy. God wills also that thou abdicate a manifold and duplex life, and that thou be content that others speak for thee. Others shall be thy gentlemen, and shall represent all courtesy and worldly life for thee; others shall do the great and resounding actions also. Thou shalt lie close hid with nature, and canst not be afforded to the Capitol or the Exchange. The world is full of renunciations and apprenticeships, and this is thine: thou must pass for a fool and a churl for a long season. This is the screen and sheath in which Pan has protected his well-beloved flower, and thou shalt be known only to thine own, and they shall console thee with tenderest love. And thou shalt not be able to rehearse the names of thy friends in thy verse, for an old shame before the holy ideal. And this is the reward: that the ideal shall be real to thee, and the impressions of the actual world shall fall like summer rain, copious, but not troublesome, to thy invulnerable essence. Thou shalt have the whole land for thy park and manor, the sea for thy bath and navigation, without tax and without envy; the woods and the rivers thou shalt own; and thou shalt possess that wherein others are only tenants and boarders. Thou true land-lord! sea-lord! air-lord! Wherever snow falls, or water flows, or birds fly, wherever day and night meet in twilight, wherever the blue heaven is hung by clouds, or sown with stars, wherever are forms with transparent boundaries, wherever are outlets into celestial space, wherever is danger, and awe, and love, there is Beauty, plenteous as rain, shed for thee, and though thou shouldest walk the world over, thou shalt not be able to find a condition inopportune or ignoble.",231534,en,en,en,a moody child and wildly wise pursued the game with joyful eyes which chose like meteors their way and rived the dark with private ray they overleapt the horizons edge searched with apollos privilege through man and woman and sea and star saw the dance of nature forward far through worlds and races and terms and times saw musical order and pairing rhymes olympian bards who sung divine ideas below which always find us young and always keep us so essay i the poet those who are esteemed umpires of taste are often persons who have acquired some knowledge of admired pictures or sculptures and have an inclination for whatever is elegant but if you inquire whether they are beautiful souls and whether their own acts are like fair pictures you learn that they are selfish and sensual their cultivation is local as if you should rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce fire all the rest remaining cold their knowledge of the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars or some limited judgment of color or form which is exercised for amusement or for show it is a proof of the shallowness of the doctrine of beauty as it lies in the minds of our amateurs that men seem to have lost the perception of the instant dependence of form upon soul there is no doctrine of forms in our philosophy we were put into our bodies as fire is put into a pan to be carried about but there is no accurate adjustment between the spirit and the organ much less is the latter the germination of the former so in regard to other forms the intellectual men do not believe in any essential dependence of the material world on thought and volition theologians think it a pretty aircastle to talk of the spiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud of a city or a contract but they prefer to come again to the solid ground of historical evidence and even the poets are contented with a civil and conformed manner of living and to write poems from the fancy at a safe distance from their own experience but the highest minds of the world have never ceased to explore the double meaning or shall i say the quadruple or the centuple or much more manifold meaning of every sensuous fact orpheus empedocles heraclitus plato plutarch dante swedenborg and the masters of sculpture picture and poetry for we are not pans and barrows nor even porters of the fire and torchbearers but children of the fire made of it and only the same divinity transmuted and at two or three removes when we know least about it and this hidden truth that the fountains whence all this river of time and its creatures floweth are intrinsically ideal and beautiful draws us to the consideration of the nature and functions of the poet or the man of beauty to the means and materials he uses and to the general aspect of the art in the present time the breadth of the problem is great for the poet is representative he stands among partial men for the complete man and apprises us not of his wealth but of the commonwealth the young man reveres men of genius because to speak truly they are more himself than he is they receive of the soul as he also receives but they more nature enhances her beauty to the eye of loving men from their belief that the poet is beholding her shows at the same time he is isolated among his contemporaries by truth and by his art but with this consolation in his pursuits that they will draw all men sooner or later for all men live by truth and stand in need of expression in love in art in avarice in politics in labor in games we study to utter our painful secret the man is only half himself the other half is his expression notwithstanding this necessity to be published adequate expression is rare i know not how it is that we need an interpreter but the great majority of men seem to be minors who have not yet come into possession of their own or mutes who cannot report the conversation they have had with nature there is no man who does not anticipate a supersensual utility in the sun and stars earth and water these stand and wait to render him a peculiar service but there is some obstruction or some excess of phlegm in our constitution which does not suffer them to yield the due effect too feeble fall the impressions of nature on us to make us artists every touch should thrill every man should be so much an artist that he could report in conversation what had befallen him yet in our experience the rays or appulses have sufficient force to arrive at the senses but not enough to reach the quick and compel the reproduction of themselves in speech the poet is the person in whom these powers are in balance the man without impediment who sees and handles that which others dream of traverses the whole scale of experience and is representative of man in virtue of being the largest power to receive and to impart for the universe has three children born at one time which reappear under different names in every system of thought whether they be called cause operation and effect or more poetically jove pluto neptune or theologically the father the spirit and the son but which we will call here the knower the doer and the sayer these stand respectively for the love of truth for the love of good and for the love of beauty these three are equal each is that which he is essentially so that he cannot be surmounted or analyzed and each of these three has the power of the others latent in him and his own patent the poet is the sayer the namer and represents beauty he is a sovereign and stands on the centre for the world is not painted or adorned but is from the beginning beautiful and god has not made some beautiful things but beauty is the creator of the universe therefore the poet is not any permissive potentate but is emperor in his own right criticism is infested with a cant of materialism which assumes that manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men and disparages such as say and do not overlooking the fact that some men namely poets are natural sayers sent into the world to the end of expression and confounds them with those whose province is action but who quit it to imitate the sayers but homers words are as costly and admirable to homer as agamemnons victories are to agamemnon the poet does not wait for the hero or the sage but as they act and think primarily so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken reckoning the others though primaries also yet in respect to him secondaries and servants as sitters or models in the studio of a painter or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect for poetry was all written before time was and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music we hear those primal warblings and attempt to write them down but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own and thus miswrite the poem the men of more delicate ear write down these cadences more faithfully and these transcripts though imperfect become the songs of the nations for nature is as truly beautiful as it is good or as it is reasonable and must as much appear as it must be done or be known words and deeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy words are also actions and actions are a kind of words the sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no man foretold he is the true and only doctor he knows and tells he is the only teller of news for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes he is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary and causal for we do not speak now of men of poetical talents or of industry and skill in metre but of the true poet i took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics a man of subtle mind whose head appeared to be a musicbox of delicate tunes and rhythms and whose skill and command of language we could not sufficiently praise but when the question arose whether he was not only a lyrist but a poet we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary not an eternal man he does not stand out of our low limitations like a chimborazo under the line running up from the torrid base through all the climates of the globe with belts of the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides but this genius is the landscapegarden of a modern house adorned with fountains and statues with wellbred men and women standing and sitting in the walks and terraces we hear through all the varied music the groundtone of conventional life our poets are men of talents who sing and not the children of music the argument is secondary the finish of the verses is primary for it is not metres but a metremaking argument that makes a poem a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own and adorns nature with a new thing the thought and the form are equal in the order of time but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form the poet has a new thought he has a whole new experience to unfold he will tell us how it was with him and all men will be the richer in his fortune for the experience of each new age requires a new confession and the world seems always waiting for its poet i remember when i was young how much i was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at table he had left his work and gone rambling none knew whither and had written hundreds of lines but could not tell whether that which was in him was therein told he could tell nothing but that all was changed man beast heaven earth and sea how gladly we listened how credulous society seemed to be compromised we sat in the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars boston seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before or was much farther than that rome what was rome plutarch and shakspeare were in the yellow leaf and homer no more should be heard of it is much to know that poetry has been written this very day under this very roof by your side what that wonderful spirit has not expired these stony moments are still sparkling and animated i had fancied that the oracles were all silent and nature had spent her fires and behold all night from every pore these fine auroras have been streaming every one has some interest in the advent of the poet and no one knows how much it may concern him we know that the secret of the world is profound but who or what shall be our interpreter we know not a mountain ramble a new style of face a new person may put the key into our hands of course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report talent may frolic and juggle genius realizes and adds mankind in good earnest have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work that the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news it is the truest word ever spoken and the phrase will be the fittest most musical and the unerring voice of the world for that time all that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is the principal event in chronology man never so often deceived still watches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth until he has made it his own with what joy i begin to read a poem which i confide in as an inspiration and now my chains are to be broken i shall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in which i live opaque though they seem transparent and from the heaven of truth i shall see and comprehend my relations that will reconcile me to life and renovate nature to see trifles animated by a tendency and to know what i am doing life will no more be a noise now i shall see men and women and know the signs by which they may be discerned from fools and satans this day shall be better than my birthday then i became an animal now i am invited into the science of the real such is the hope but the fruition is postponed oftener it falls that this winged man who will carry me into the heaven whirls me into the clouds then leaps and frisks about with me from cloud to cloud still affirming that he is bound heavenward and i being myself a novice am slow in perceiving that he does not know the way into the heavens and is merely bent that i should admire his skill to rise like a fowl or a flying fish a little way from the ground or the water but the allpiercing allfeeding and ocular air of heaven that man shall never inhabit i tumble down again soon into my old nooks and lead the life of exaggerations as before and have lost my faith in the possibility of any guide who can lead me thither where i would be but leaving these victims of vanity let us with new hope observe how nature by worthier impulses has ensured the poets fidelity to his office of announcement and affirming namely by the beauty of things which becomes a new and higher beauty when expressed nature offers all her creatures to him as a picturelanguage being used as a type a second wonderful value appears in the object far better than its old value as the carpenters stretched cord if you hold your ear close enough is musical in the breeze things more excellent than every image says jamblichus are expressed through images things admit of being used as symbols because nature is a symbol in the whole and in every part every line we can draw in the sand has expression and there is no body without its spirit or genius all form is an effect of character all condition of the quality of the life all harmony of health and for this reason a perception of beauty should be sympathetic or proper only to the good the beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary the soul makes the body as the wise spenser teaches so every spirit as it is most pure and hath in it the more of heavenly light so it the fairer body doth procure to habit in and it more fairly dight with cheerful grace and amiable sight for of the soul the body form doth take for soul is form and doth the body makehere we find ourselves suddenly not in a critical speculation but in a holy place and should go very warily and reverently we stand before the secret of the world there where being passes into appearance and unity into variety the universe is the externisation of the soul wherever the life is that bursts into appearance around it our science is sensual and therefore superficial the earth and the heavenly bodies physics and chemistry we sensually treat as if they were selfexistent but these are the retinue of that being we have the mighty heaven said proclus exhibits in its transfigurations clear images of the splendor of intellectual perceptions being moved in conjunction with the unapparent periods of intellectual natures therefore science always goes abreast with the just elevation of the man keeping step with religion and metaphysics or the state of science is an index of our selfknowledge since everything in nature answers to a moral power if any phenomenon remains brute and dark it is that the corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet active no wonder then if these waters be so deep that we hover over them with a religious regard the beauty of the fable proves the importance of the sense to the poet and to all others or if you please every man is so far a poet as to be susceptible of these enchantments of nature for all men have the thoughts whereof the universe is the celebration i find that the fascination resides in the symbol who loves nature who does not is it only poets and men of leisure and cultivation who live with her no but also hunters farmers grooms and butchers though they express their affection in their choice of life and not in their choice of words the writer wonders what the coachman or the hunter values in riding in horses and dogs it is not superficial qualities when you talk with him he holds these at as slight a rate as you his worship is sympathetic he has no definitions but he is commanded in nature by the living power which he feels to be there present no imitation or playing of these things would content him he loves the earnest of the northwind of rain of stone and wood and iron a beauty not explicable is dearer than a beauty which we can see to the end of it is nature the symbol nature certifying the supernatural body overflowed by life which he worships with coarse but sincere rites the inwardness and mystery of this attachment drives men of every class to the use of emblems the schools of poets and philosophers are not more intoxicated with their symbols than the populace with theirs in our political parties compute the power of badges and emblems see the great ball which they roll from baltimore to bunker hill in the political processions lowell goes in a loom and lynn in a shoe and salem in a ship witness the ciderbarrel the logcabin the hickorystick the palmetto and all the cognizances of party see the power of national emblems some stars lilies leopards a crescent a lion an eagle or other figure which came into credit god knows how on an old rag of bunting blowing in the wind on a fort at the ends of the earth shall make the blood tingle under the rudest or the most conventional exterior the people fancy they hate poetry and they are all poets and mystics beyond this universality of the symbolic language we are apprised of the divineness of this superior use of things whereby the world is a temple whose walls are covered with emblems pictures and commandments of the deity in this that there is no fact in nature which does not carry the whole sense of nature and the distinctions which we make in events and in affairs of low and high honest and base disappear when nature is used as a symbol thought makes every thing fit for use the vocabulary of an omniscient man would embrace words and images excluded from polite conversation what would be base or even obscene to the obscene becomes illustrious spoken in a new connexion of thought the piety of the hebrew prophets purges their grossness the circumcision is an example of the power of poetry to raise the low and offensive small and mean things serve as well as great symbols the meaner the type by which a law is expressed the more pungent it is and the more lasting in the memories of men just as we choose the smallest box or case in which any needful utensil can be carried bare lists of words are found suggestive to an imaginative and excited mind as it is related of lord chatham that he was accustomed to read in baileys dictionary when he was preparing to speak in parliament the poorest experience is rich enough for all the purposes of expressing thought why covet a knowledge of new facts day and night house and garden a few books a few actions serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles we are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use we can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity it does not need that a poem should be long every word was once a poem every new relation is a new word also we use defects and deformities to a sacred purpose so expressing our sense that the evils of the world are such only to the evil eye in the old mythology mythologists observe defects are ascribed to divine natures as lameness to vulcan blindness to cupid and the like to signify exuberances for as it is dislocation and detachment from the life of god that makes things ugly the poet who reattaches things to nature and the whole reattaching even artificial things and violations of nature to nature by a deeper insight disposes very easily of the most disagreeable facts readers of poetry see the factoryvillage and the railway and fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken up by these for these works of art are not yet consecrated in their reading but the poet sees them fall within the great order not less than the beehive or the spiders geometrical web nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own besides in a centred mind it signifies nothing how many mechanical inventions you exhibit though you add millions and never so surprising the fact of mechanics has not gained a grains weight the spiritual fact remains unalterable by many or by few particulars as no mountain is of any appreciable height to break the curve of the sphere a shrewd countryboy goes to the city for the first time and the complacent citizen is not satisfied with his little wonder it is not that he does not see all the fine houses and know that he never saw such before but he disposes of them as easily as the poet finds place for the railway the chief value of the new fact is to enhance the great and constant fact of life which can dwarf any and every circumstance and to which the belt of wampum and the commerce of america are alike the world being thus put under the mind for verb and noun the poet is he who can articulate it for though life is great and fascinates and absorbs and though all men are intelligent of the symbols through which it is named yet they cannot originally use them we are symbols and inhabit symbols workman work and tools words and things birth and death all are emblems but we sympathize with the symbols and being infatuated with the economical uses of things we do not know that they are thoughts the poet by an ulterior intellectual perception gives them a power which makes their old use forgotten and puts eyes and a tongue into every dumb and inanimate object he perceives the independence of the thought on the symbol the stability of the thought the accidency and fugacity of the symbol as the eyes of lyncaeus were said to see through the earth so the poet turns the world to glass and shows us all things in their right series and procession for through that better perception he stands one step nearer to things and sees the flowing or metamorphosis perceives that thought is multiform that within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form and following with his eyes the life uses the forms which express that life and so his speech flows with the flowing of nature all the facts of the animal economy sex nutriment gestation birth growth are symbols of the passage of the world into the soul of man to suffer there a change and reappear a new and higher fact he uses forms according to the life and not according to the form this is true science the poet alone knows astronomy chemistry vegetation and animation for he does not stop at these facts but employs them as signs he knows why the plain or meadow of space was strewn with these flowers we call suns and moons and stars why the great deep is adorned with animals with men and gods for in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought by virtue of this science the poet is the namer or languagemaker naming things sometimes after their appearance sometimes after their essence and giving to every one its own name and not anothers thereby rejoicing the intellect which delights in detachment or boundary the poets made all the words and therefore language is the archives of history and if we must say it a sort of tomb of the muses for though the origin of most of our words is forgotten each word was at first a stroke of genius and obtained currency because for the moment it symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer the etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture language is fossil poetry as the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules so language is made up of images or tropes which now in their secondary use have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin but the poet names the thing because he sees it or comes one step nearer to it than any other this expression or naming is not art but a second nature grown out of the first as a leaf out of a tree what we call nature is a certain selfregulated motion or change and nature does all things by her own hands and does not leave another to baptise her but baptises herself and this through the metamorphosis again i remember that a certain poet described it to me thus genius is the activity which repairs the decays of things whether wholly or partly of a material and finite kind nature through all her kingdoms insures herself nobody cares for planting the poor fungus so she shakes down from the gills of one agaric countless spores any one of which being preserved transmits new billions of spores tomorrow or next day the new agaric of this hour has a chance which the old one had not this atom of seed is thrown into a new place not subject to the accidents which destroyed its parent two rods off she makes a man and having brought him to ripe age she will no longer run the risk of losing this wonder at a blow but she detaches from him a new self that the kind may be safe from accidents to which the individual is exposed so when the soul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought she detaches and sends away from it its poems or songs a fearless sleepless deathless progeny which is not exposed to the accidents of the weary kingdom of time a fearless vivacious offspring clad with wings such was the virtue of the soul out of which they came which carry them fast and far and infix them irrecoverably into the hearts of men these wings are the beauty of the poets soul the songs thus flying immortal from their mortal parent are pursued by clamorous flights of censures which swarm in far greater numbers and threaten to devour them but these last are not winged at the end of a very short leap they fall plump down and rot having received from the souls out of which they came no beautiful wings but the melodies of the poet ascend and leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time so far the bard taught me using his freer speech but nature has a higher end in the production of new individuals than security namely ascension or the passage of the soul into higher forms i knew in my younger days the sculptor who made the statue of the youth which stands in the public garden he was as i remember unable to tell directly what made him happy or unhappy but by wonderful indirections he could tell he rose one day according to his habit before the dawn and saw the morning break grand as the eternity out of which it came and for many days after he strove to express this tranquillity and lo his chisel had fashioned out of marble the form of a beautiful youth phosphorus whose aspect is such that it is said all persons who look on it become silent the poet also resigns himself to his mood and that thought which agitated him is expressed but alter idem in a manner totally new the expression is organic or the new type which things themselves take when liberated as in the sun objects paint their images on the retina of the eye so they sharing the aspiration of the whole universe tend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence in his mind like the metamorphosis of things into higher organic forms is their change into melodies over everything stands its daemon or soul and as the form of the thing is reflected by the eye so the soul of the thing is reflected by a melody the sea the mountainridge niagara and every flowerbed preexist or superexist in precantations which sail like odors in the air and when any man goes by with an ear sufficiently fine he overhears them and endeavors to write down the notes without diluting or depraving them and herein is the legitimation of criticism in the minds faith that the poems are a corrupt version of some text in nature with which they ought to be made to tally a rhyme in one of our sonnets should not be less pleasing than the iterated nodes of a seashell or the resembling difference of a group of flowers the pairing of the birds is an idyl not tedious as our idyls are a tempest is a rough ode without falsehood or rant a summer with its harvest sown reaped and stored is an epic song subordinating how many admirably executed parts why should not the symmetry and truth that modulate these glide into our spirits and we participate the invention of nature this insight which expresses itself by what is called imagination is a very high sort of seeing which does not come by study but by the intellect being where and what it sees by sharing the path or circuit of things through forms and so making them translucid to others the path of things is silent will they suffer a speaker to go with them a spy they will not suffer a lover a poet is the transcendency of their own nature him they will suffer the condition of true naming on the poets part is his resigning himself to the divine aura which breathes through forms and accompanying that it is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns that beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious intellect he is capable of a new energy as of an intellect doubled on itself by abandonment to the nature of things that beside his privacy of power as an individual man there is a great public power on which he can draw by unlocking at all risks his human doors and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him then he is caught up into the life of the universe his speech is thunder his thought is law and his words are universally intelligible as the plants and animals the poet knows that he speaks adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly or with the flower of the mind not with the intellect used as an organ but with the intellect released from all service and suffered to take its direction from its celestial life or as the ancients were wont to express themselves not with intellect alone but with the intellect inebriated by nectar as the traveller who has lost his way throws his reins on his horses neck and trusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road so must we do with the divine animal who carries us through this world for if in any manner we can stimulate this instinct new passages are opened for us into nature the mind flows into and through things hardest and highest and the metamorphosis is possible this is the reason why bards love wine mead narcotics coffee tea opium the fumes of sandalwood and tobacco or whatever other species of animal exhilaration all men avail themselves of such means as they can to add this extraordinary power to their normal powers and to this end they prize conversation music pictures sculpture dancing theatres travelling war mobs fires gaming politics or love or science or animal intoxication which are several coarser or finer quasimechanical substitutes for the true nectar which is the ravishment of the intellect by coming nearer to the fact these are auxiliaries to the centrifugal tendency of a man to his passage out into free space and they help him to escape the custody of that body in which he is pent up and of that jailyard of individual relations in which he is enclosed hence a great number of such as were professionally expressors of beauty as painters poets musicians and actors have been more than others wont to lead a life of pleasure and indulgence all but the few who received the true nectar and as it was a spurious mode of attaining freedom as it was an emancipation not into the heavens but into the freedom of baser places they were punished for that advantage they won by a dissipation and deterioration but never can any advantage be taken of nature by a trick the spirit of the world the great calm presence of the creator comes not forth to the sorceries of opium or of wine the sublime vision comes to the pure and simple soul in a clean and chaste body that is not an inspiration which we owe to narcotics but some counterfeit excitement and fury milton says that the lyric poet may drink wine and live generously but the epic poet he who shall sing of the gods and their descent unto men must drink water out of a wooden bowl for poetry is not devils wine but gods wine it is with this as it is with toys we fill the hands and nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls drums and horses withdrawing their eyes from the plain face and sufficing objects of nature the sun and moon the animals the water and stones which should be their toys so the poets habit of living should be set on a key so low and plain that the common influences should delight him his cheerfulness should be the gift of the sunlight the air should suffice for his inspiration and he should be tipsy with water that spirit which suffices quiet hearts which seems to come forth to such from every dry knoll of sere grass from every pinestump and halfimbedded stone on which the dull march sun shines comes forth to the poor and hungry and such as are of simple taste if thou fill thy brain with boston and new york with fashion and covetousness and wilt stimulate thy jaded senses with wine and french coffee thou shalt find no radiance of wisdom in the lonely waste of the pinewoods if the imagination intoxicates the poet it is not inactive in other men the metamorphosis excites in the beholder an emotion of joy the use of symbols has a certain power of emancipation and exhilaration for all men we seem to be touched by a wand which makes us dance and run about happily like children we are like persons who come out of a cave or cellar into the open air this is the effect on us of tropes fables oracles and all poetic forms poets are thus liberating gods men have really got a new sense and found within their world another world or nest of worlds for the metamorphosis once seen we divine that it does not stop i will not now consider how much this makes the charm of algebra and the mathematics which also have their tropes but it is felt in every definition as when aristotle defines space to be an immovable vessel in which things are contained or when plato defines a line to be a flowing point or figure to be a bound of solid and many the like what a joyful sense of freedom we have when vitruvius announces the old opinion of artists that no architect can build any house well who does not know something of anatomy when socrates in charmides tells us that the soul is cured of its maladies by certain incantations and that these incantations are beautiful reasons from which temperance is generated in souls when plato calls the world an animal and timaeus affirms that the plants also are animals or affirms a man to be a heavenly tree growing with his root which is his head upward and as george chapman following him writes so in our tree of man whose nervie root springs in his topwhen orpheus speaks of hoariness as that white flower which marks extreme old age when proclus calls the universe the statue of the intellect when chaucer in his praise of gentilesse compares good blood in mean condition to fire which though carried to the darkest house betwixt this and the mount of caucasus will yet hold its natural office and burn as bright as if twenty thousand men did it behold when john saw in the apocalypse the ruin of the world through evil and the stars fall from heaven as the figtree casteth her untimely fruit when aesop reports the whole catalogue of common daily relations through the masquerade of birds and beasts we take the cheerful hint of the immortality of our essence and its versatile habit and escapes as when the gypsies say it is in vain to hang them they cannot die the poets are thus liberating gods the ancient british bards had for the title of their order those who are free throughout the world they are free and they make free an imaginative book renders us much more service at first by stimulating us through its tropes than afterward when we arrive at the precise sense of the author i think nothing is of any value in books excepting the transcendental and extraordinary if a man is inflamed and carried away by his thought to that degree that he forgets the authors and the public and heeds only this one dream which holds him like an insanity let me read his paper and you may have all the arguments and histories and criticism all the value which attaches to pythagoras paracelsus cornelius agrippa cardan kepler swedenborg schelling oken or any other who introduces questionable facts into his cosmogony as angels devils magic astrology palmistry mesmerism and so on is the certificate we have of departure from routine and that here is a new witness that also is the best success in conversation the magic of liberty which puts the world like a ball in our hands how cheap even the liberty then seems how mean to study when an emotion communicates to the intellect the power to sap and upheave nature how great the perspective nations times systems enter and disappear like threads in tapestry of large figure and many colors dream delivers us to dream and while the drunkenness lasts we will sell our bed our philosophy our religion in our opulence there is good reason why we should prize this liberation the fate of the poor shepherd who blinded and lost in the snowstorm perishes in a drift within a few feet of his cottage door is an emblem of the state of man on the brink of the waters of life and truth we are miserably dying the inaccessibleness of every thought but that we are in is wonderful what if you come near to it you are as remote when you are nearest as when you are farthest every thought is also a prison every heaven is also a prison therefore we love the poet the inventor who in any form whether in an ode or in an action or in looks and behavior has yielded us a new thought he unlocks our chains and admits us to a new scene this emancipation is dear to all men and the power to impart it as it must come from greater depth and scope of thought is a measure of intellect therefore all books of the imagination endure all which ascend to that truth that the writer sees nature beneath him and uses it as his exponent every verse or sentence possessing this virtue will take care of its own immortality the religions of the world are the ejaculations of a few imaginative men but the quality of the imagination is to flow and not to freeze the poet did not stop at the color or the form but read their meaning neither may he rest in this meaning but he makes the same objects exponents of his new thought here is the difference betwixt the poet and the mystic that the last nails a symbol to one sense which was a true sense for a moment but soon becomes old and false for all symbols are fluxional all language is vehicular and transitive and is good as ferries and horses are for conveyance not as farms and houses are for homestead mysticism consists in the mistake of an accidental and individual symbol for an universal one the morningredness happens to be the favorite meteor to the eyes of jacob behmen and comes to stand to him for truth and faith and he believes should stand for the same realities to every reader but the first reader prefers as naturally the symbol of a mother and child or a gardener and his bulb or a jeweller polishing a gem either of these or of a myriad more are equally good to the person to whom they are significant only they must be held lightly and be very willingly translated into the equivalent terms which others use and the mystic must be steadily told all that you say is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it let us have a little algebra instead of this trite rhetoric universal signs instead of these village symbols and we shall both be gainers the history of hierarchies seems to show that all religious error consisted in making the symbol too stark and solid and at last nothing but an excess of the organ of language swedenborg of all men in the recent ages stands eminently for the translator of nature into thought i do not know the man in history to whom things stood so uniformly for words before him the metamorphosis continually plays everything on which his eye rests obeys the impulses of moral nature the figs become grapes whilst he eats them when some of his angels affirmed a truth the laurel twig which they held blossomed in their hands the noise which at a distance appeared like gnashing and thumping on coming nearer was found to be the voice of disputants the men in one of his visions seen in heavenly light appeared like dragons and seemed in darkness but to each other they appeared as men and when the light from heaven shone into their cabin they complained of the darkness and were compelled to shut the window that they might see there was this perception in him which makes the poet or seer an object of awe and terror namely that the same man or society of men may wear one aspect to themselves and their companions and a different aspect to higher intelligences certain priests whom he describes as conversing very learnedly together appeared to the children who were at some distance like dead horses and many the like misappearances and instantly the mind inquires whether these fishes under the bridge yonder oxen in the pasture those dogs in the yard are immutably fishes oxen and dogs or only so appear to me and perchance to themselves appear upright men and whether i appear as a man to all eyes the bramins and pythagoras propounded the same question and if any poet has witnessed the transformation he doubtless found it in harmony with various experiences we have all seen changes as considerable in wheat and caterpillars he is the poet and shall draw us with love and terror who sees through the flowing vest the firm nature and can declare it i look in vain for the poet whom i describe we do not with sufficient plainness or sufficient profoundness address ourselves to life nor dare we chaunt our own times and social circumstance if we filled the day with bravery we should not shrink from celebrating it time and nature yield us many gifts but not yet the timely man the new religion the reconciler whom all things await dantes praise is that he dared to write his autobiography in colossal cipher or into universality we have yet had no genius in america with tyrannous eye which knew the value of our incomparable materials and saw in the barbarism and materialism of the times another carnival of the same gods whose picture he so much admires in homer then in the middle age then in calvinism banks and tariffs the newspaper and caucus methodism and unitarianism are flat and dull to dull people but rest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of troy and the temple of delphos and are as swiftly passing away our logrolling our stumps and their politics our fisheries our negroes and indians our boasts and our repudiations the wrath of rogues and the pusillanimity of honest men the northern trade the southern planting the western clearing oregon and texas are yet unsung yet america is a poem in our eyes its ample geography dazzles the imagination and it will not wait long for metres if i have not found that excellent combination of gifts in my countrymen which i seek neither could i aid myself to fix the idea of the poet by reading now and then in chalmerss collection of five centuries of english poets these are wits more than poets though there have been poets among them but when we adhere to the ideal of the poet we have our difficulties even with milton and homer milton is too literary and homer too literal and historical but i am not wise enough for a national criticism and must use the old largeness a little longer to discharge my errand from the muse to the poet concerning his art art is the path of the creator to his work the paths or methods are ideal and eternal though few men ever see them not the artist himself for years or for a lifetime unless he come into the conditions the painter the sculptor the composer the epic rhapsodist the orator all partake one desire namely to express themselves symmetrically and abundantly not dwarfishly and fragmentarily they found or put themselves in certain conditions as the painter and sculptor before some impressive human figures the orator into the assembly of the people and the others in such scenes as each has found exciting to his intellect and each presently feels the new desire he hears a voice he sees a beckoning then he is apprised with wonder what herds of daemons hem him in he can no more rest he says with the old painter by god it is in me and must go forth of me he pursues a beauty half seen which flies before him the poet pours out verses in every solitude most of the things he says are conventional no doubt but by and by he says something which is original and beautiful that charms him he would say nothing else but such things in our way of talking we say that is yours this is mine but the poet knows well that it is not his that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to you he would fain hear the like eloquence at length once having tasted this immortal ichor he cannot have enough of it and as an admirable creative power exists in these intellections it is of the last importance that these things get spoken what a little of all we know is said what drops of all the sea of our science are baled up and by what accident it is that these are exposed when so many secrets sleep in nature hence the necessity of speech and song hence these throbs and heartbeatings in the orator at the door of the assembly to the end namely that thought may be ejaculated as logos or word doubt not o poet but persist say it is in me and shall out stand there baulked and dumb stuttering and stammering hissed and hooted stand and strive until at last rage draw out of thee that dreampower which every night shows thee is thine own a power transcending all limit and privacy and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity nothing walks or creeps or grows or exists which must not in turn arise and walk before him as exponent of his meaning comes he to that power his genius is no longer exhaustible all the creatures by pairs and by tribes pour into his mind as into a noahs ark to come forth again to people a new world this is like the stock of air for our respiration or for the combustion of our fireplace not a measure of gallons but the entire atmosphere if wanted and therefore the rich poets as homer chaucer shakspeare and raphael have obviously no limits to their works except the limits of their lifetime and resemble a mirror carried through the street ready to render an image of every created thing o poet a new nobility is conferred in groves and pastures and not in castles or by the swordblade any longer the conditions are hard but equal thou shalt leave the world and know the muse only thou shalt not know any longer the times customs graces politics or opinions of men but shalt take all from the muse for the time of towns is tolled from the world by funereal chimes but in nature the universal hours are counted by succeeding tribes of animals and plants and by growth of joy on joy god wills also that thou abdicate a manifold and duplex life and that thou be content that others speak for thee others shall be thy gentlemen and shall represent all courtesy and worldly life for thee others shall do the great and resounding actions also thou shalt lie close hid with nature and canst not be afforded to the capitol or the exchange the world is full of renunciations and apprenticeships and this is thine thou must pass for a fool and a churl for a long season this is the screen and sheath in which pan has protected his wellbeloved flower and thou shalt be known only to thine own and they shall console thee with tenderest love and thou shalt not be able to rehearse the names of thy friends in thy verse for an old shame before the holy ideal and this is the reward that the ideal shall be real to thee and the impressions of the actual world shall fall like summer rain copious but not troublesome to thy invulnerable essence thou shalt have the whole land for thy park and manor the sea for thy bath and navigation without tax and without envy the woods and the rivers thou shalt own and thou shalt possess that wherein others are only tenants and boarders thou true landlord sealord airlord wherever snow falls or water flows or birds fly wherever day and night meet in twilight wherever the blue heaven is hung by clouds or sown with stars wherever are forms with transparent boundaries wherever are outlets into celestial space wherever is danger and awe and love there is

These scenes won't sustain
Deep inside me feeling so sad
I hear the last call, the curtain will fall
And the mirror reflects what is left...

So its creatures keep drifting within...

Will I ever see it again

The dreams of this kind are buried
Somewhere back in time
But the spirit's still there...

So I've faced the abyss, saw sentiments in black
My love lies slowly bleeding, there ain't no turning back
No spear will hit me likely to rebound
Execute yourself the cost you have to count
Should have broke the curfew that night to rescue her
Straining at the leash she died - straight-faced life has died
Welcome to our real world it's your own
Director's cut of life
Where your point of view keeps hard to state -
See objections rise
Spinning around in treadmills until you're consciousless
In time resignation substitutes belief

Your guide is lost what still remains
Is trusting in yourself
Take the chance to climb this ladder high -
The tide is rising
Expectations can't be too great than to be fulfilled
Reality just bites but doesn't kill

Light up a light into the night
Try to set the past on fire
Light up a light into the night
And burn what you find there

Throw up a spark into the dark
Make the flames go rising higher
Throw up a spark into the dark
Before the spirit's lost

And give me back my dreams
Whatever it will take me
Give me back my dreams whatever it will take me

Good morning, Mr. Brand.

[Russell Brand]
Good morning.

[Chair]
Please have a seat. Mr. Brand, Mr. Somers, thank you for giving evidence to the Committee’s inquiry into drugs. Mr. Russell Brand, you gave written evidence to this Committee, which Members of the Committee have read. Could I start with a point about what you say in your evidence that you disagree with the legalisation of drugs because you think that a deterrent effect is necessary, is that right?

[Russell Brand]
I don’t feel entirely qualified to talk about legislation. For me, what is more significant is the way that we socially regard the condition of addiction. It is something that I consider to be an illness and, therefore, more a health matter than a criminal or judicial matter. As I said, I don’t think legalisation is something that I am particularly qualified to get into. In fact, I can see areas where decriminalisation might be considered useful and more efficient in countries, like Portugal or Switzerland, where there have been trials. It seems to have had some efficacy. But for me it is more important that we regard people suffering from addiction with compassion and that there is a pragmatic rather than symbolic approach to treating it. The legislative status of addiction, and the criminalisation of addicts, is kind of symbolic and not really functional. I don’t see how it especially helps, but I am not saying, “let’s have a wacky free-for-all, let people go around taking drugs”. It didn’t help me much.

[Chair]
You are a former heroin addict.

[Russell Brand]
Yes.

[Chair]
Briefly, could you tell us how you got on to drugs and then how you managed to come off it, and how many years you were on hard drugs.
[Russell Brand]
I see you have incorporated the word “briefly” now into the question. As you already know, it is my propensity for verbosity. I became a drug addict, I think, because of emotional difficulties, psychological difficulties and perhaps a spiritual malady. For me, taking drugs and excessive drinking were the result of a psychological, spiritual or mental condition, so they are symptomatic. I was sad, lonely, unhappy and detached, and drugs and alcohol for me seemed like a solution to that problem. Once I dealt with the emotional, spiritual, mental impetus, I no longer felt the need to take drugs or use drugs. Actually, I got clean at Chip Somers’ facility, Focus 12, which is abstinence-based recovery. That is what we essentially believe in: if you have the disease or the illness of addiction or alcoholism, the best way to tackle it is to not use drugs in any form, whether it is state-sponsored opiates, like methadone or illegal street drugs, or a legal substance like alcohol. We see no distinction between these substances. What we believe in is that abstinence-based recovery is the best solution, for people suffering from this condition, and that support structures exist to get people to maintain recovery—abstinence-based recovery. What we want is more research and funding into abstinence-based recovery and to be able to filter people towards this new lifestyle where, actually, criminalisation becomes less of an issue, in my view, because it takes people that have to indulge in criminal activity to fund their habits and gets them into being valuable members of society. Was that brief enough?

[Chair]
Very brief, thank you. You were arrested, roughly, 12 times-

[Russell Brand]
It was rough, yes.

[Chair]
-by the police and the justice system. Do you think that when you were arrested that you had the kind of support that you needed, and people like you who were arrested, being involved in drugs, the rehabilitation and the support that was needed to get you off drugs? How did the criminal justice system react to you after your arrests?

[Russell Brand]
From my experience, speaking to people in the criminal justice system, and from my own personal experience being arrested, there is some confusion and ignorance around addiction. That is quite understandable because a lot of drug addicts—speaking personally—are anti-social. They are a strain on society. They necessarily engage in criminal activity. They are a public nuisance in many ways.I felt when I was arrested that the police were doing a necessary job of enforcing the laws of this country, and that they were doing what they had to do. It wasn’t until I had access to abstinence-based recovery that I was able to change my behaviour and significantly reduce—all but obliterate—my criminal activity, apart from the occasional skirmish.

[Chair]
The final question from me on this section is the issue of legal highs. We have been very concerned in the evidence that we have received about the number of legal highs that are available, and young people who seem to be able to take legal highs. Whenever they are banned or proposed to be banned a new legal high emerges. Do you think this is something that does affect young people? Is this now the drug of choice for young people?

[Russell Brand]
I don’t know because I am not young enough anymore. I know that young people will always want to get high, and I think that what we need is a pragmatic approach to this. For me, in a way—as I said before, Keith—it is not significant the substance they are using, whether it is alcohol or illegal street drugs. The legal status of a drug is irrelevant to a drug addict. If you are a drug addict, you are getting drugs, that’s it, you are going to get them. So in a way it is probably best to make it simple.

As for legal highs, what I think we need to do is address the social, mental and spiritual problems that are leading young people, or people of all ages, into taking drugs. So I think what we need is research into abstinence-based recovery and more awareness around it.

[Chair]
We will come on to some of those points with other questions.
[Bridget Phillipson]
You are currently working on a programme about addiction and how it is viewed in society. What messages are you hoping to get across in that programme?

[Russell Brand]
The messages that we are hoping to get across in this programme is that maintenance of drug addiction, through state-sponsored substances, like methadone, should only be deployed as part of a reduction, with the ultimate aim of abstinence-based recovery; that we need to start regarding addiction, in all its forms, as a health issue, as opposed to a judicial and criminal issue; that we need to change the laws in this country; that we need to have more compassionate, altruistic, loving attitudes to the people with the disease of addiction and recognise that these people, with the proper help and access to the proper treatment, can become active and helpful members of society, like myself—some would argue that point—or perhaps, more obviously, Chip Somers, a man with a criminal record as long as your arm, who now runs a treatment centre and has been clean for 27 years. That is the message: that we don’t want to discard people; we don’t want to life them off on methadone and leave them on the sidelines. We need to bring them into society, offer them treatment and, once again, neutralise the toxic, social threat that they offer as criminals, because they have to fund their habit, or even if it is a legal drug, like alcohol, they are clattering into things, driving drunk, pain in the arse people. We need to offer them treatment and activate them and incorporate them into our society. So the message is ultimately one of pragmatism, altruism and compassion in all areas of the condition.

[Chair]
Thank you. Mr Somers, we will have specific questions for you, but if you want to chip in—if I may put it like that—at any stage, please feel free to do so. Is there anything you want to add to what you have heard so far?

[Chip Somers, Chief Executive, Focus 12]
I think he is doing splendidly.

[Russell Brand]
Thanks, Chip. Chip runs the treatment centre where I got clean so—

[Chair]
Yes, we are coming on to him in a minute, Mr Brand.

[Russell Brand]
He is already the puppeteer behind each and every articulation.

[Chair]
Thank you, Mr Brand.

[Michael Ellis]
Mr Brand, you have said that addiction is an illness.
[Russell Brand]
Yes.

[Michael Ellis]
Would you say that it is also fair to characterise it as self-induced, to a large extent, unlike many other illnesses?

[Russell Brand]
Not really.

[Michael Ellis]
Also, that it does carry with it victims. Many people who are on drugs commit offences against other people, do they not? So it differs in that respect as well, doesn’t it? When one is looking at the criminal justice system, doesn’t one also have to have some compassion and consideration for the victims of crime, where those crimes are committed by people under the influence of drugs?

[Russell Brand]
Michael, I am very glad you have asked me that question. It is a very important question and it is one that we need to address. Of course, the victims of acquisitive drug-related crimes are important and need to be taken care of. We were with Chief Superintendent Graham Bartlett of Sussex Police the other day, a wonderful man, a good civic minded gentleman. It is his belief that by regarding addiction as an illness, by offering treatment instead of a more punitive approach, we can prevent people from committing crimes. Just personally, I was a criminal when I was drug addict, by virtue of my addiction, and the ways that I had to acquire money to get drugs. Anecdotally, Chip was an armed robber, in and out of nick all the time—I hope you don’t mind me telling them this—and other people I have met, you know, criminality is a necessary component. Of course we are not saying forget the victims, but I am saying it is better to address the social situation pragmatically. I think we all know this. By prescribing methadone to people, most people on methadone are using illegal drugs to supplement their habit. They are not addressing the root problems. We need to approach the victims with respect. Where there has been criminal behaviour it needs to be dealt with correctly, but perhaps within the penal system itself we can offer treatment to addicts, like the brilliant work that is done by RAPt in various institutions and prisons.

[Michael Ellis]
You would say there needs to be carrot and stick, would you?

[Russell Brand]
I don’t think there needs to be a carrot or a stick. Both of those things are like bizarre metaphors. What there needs to be is love and compassion for everybody involved. If people are committing criminal behaviour then it needs to be dealt with legally, but you need to offer them treatment, not simply out of some airy fairy, “let’s hold hands and hug” liberalism, but because it deals with the problem and it prevents further crimes being committed. Addicts that get clean one day at a time, through abstinence-based recovery, generally speaking, stop committing crimes. That is better for victims. It is better for the addicts. It is better for society.

[Michael Ellis]
The role that celebrities play in society is not insignificant. I want to ask you whether—

[Russell Brand]
I would argue that it is insignificant, and that is why they play that role.

[Michael Ellis]
Perhaps it should be more than it is, but what I want to know from you, Mr. Brand, is whether, having got out of the cycle of addiction, and I congratulate you for that—

[Russell Brand]
Thank you.

[Michael Ellis]
—you would like to position yourself as a role model in society for those who might look to you as an example?

[Russell Brand]
As the great 2Pac Shakur said, “role is something people play, model is something that people make. Both of those things are fake.” What I want to offer people is truth and authenticity in the treatment of this illness, in our regard to the criminal components of it, in assisting victims and in the way we legislate and organise our society. As you know, I can’t be responsible—you lot hold committees all the time about the reprehensible behaviour of our media—what the cipher of my image is used to represent in the media, I have no control over.

[Michael Ellis]
You do. Forgive me, you do because your behaviour is some aspect of what is portrayed about you, isn’t it?

[Russell Brand]
Yes, of course, but how is this going to be written up? This could be written up as, “Michael Ellis is sprawled on a pin there by the wit of Brand” or they could say, “recalcitrant former drug addict rambled on.” If you read it in The Telegraph it is going to say one thing; if you read it in the Socialist Worker it is going to say another thing.

[Michael Ellis]
It probably will be a combination.

[Russell Brand]
Of course the objective behaviour has components, but I am saying that what I want to offer people is truth and authenticity. Celebrity, as we all know, is a vapid, vacuous, toxic concept used to distract people from what is actually important, and in this case that is the treatment of people with the disease of addiction.

[Chair]
Yes, Mr Somers.

[Chip Somers]
As far as we were concerned, those people who are brave enough, who are both celebrities and recovering addicts, have a profound effect on the number of people who seek treatment because it gives out a very positive message that recovery is possible. When Russell Brand’s book came out the number of referrals to our treatment centre was just hugely exaggerated because people suddenly discovered that treatment was possible, help was possible and people could get better, and it made a profound difference. I would hope that actually more people in the public eye—well, I suppose, being celebrities they are in the public eye—will come forward and have the bravery to do so, because it does encourage people.

[Michael Ellis]
So celebrities can be a very positive role model?

[Chip Somers]
Absolutely. Of course, then it can backfire as well when people make a big fuss about being in recovery and then relapse. That is unfortunate. But we are fortunate with Russell that he is maintaining a good recovery, and that continues to be a good role model.

[Chair]
Mr Brand, do you think more people need to know about things, like cocaine production and where cocaine comes from? The Committee went to Colombia to look at the effects that the harvesting of cocaine was having on the people of Colombia, who are extraordinarily poor and were forced to be involved in this kind of activity. Do you think if there were more focus on where it all came from, and how it affected communities, that would help to stop people getting involved?

[Russell Brand
No, Keith. No more than the industrial consequences of oil production affect people using their cars. People don’t care about industry. People care about getting the resource that they require. The illegality makes no difference, the consequences in the nation of origin make no difference. What we need is to address the emotional, mental and spiritual problems that lead to addiction. Of course, any illegal industry, or the cocaine manufacture in South American nations, or wherever, has a negative consequence for their nations but I don’t think that that is something that individual drug addicts are going to be affected by, to be honest, because they are normally on drugs.

[Lorraine Fullbrook]
I would like to ask a question to Mr Somers. Focus 12 has three high profile patrons: Mr. Brand, Davina McCall and Boy George. That is something that was probably unthinkable about 50 years ago. Do you think that has led to the destigmatisation of addiction, or do you think it has led to a wider acceptance of drug use in society generally?

[Chip Somers]
I don’t think it has encouraged people to use drugs. I think there have been some people who have made a positive—

[Russell Brand]
This lady has to get by. Sorry, love.

[Chip Somers]
I was right in the middle of my answer then.

[Russell Brand]
Still a good speech. There were just some ladies going by.

[Chair]
I think the public is fine. Yes, Mr Somers.

[Chip Somers]
Do you know I have completely forgotten where I was.

[Russell Brand]
That is because he was flirting with them two.

[Lorraine Fullbrook]
It was about high profile patrons and de-stigmatisation or does it lead to a wider acceptance?

[Chip Somers]
Yes. There are certain celebrities who have made a positive message about drug use. It has not helped the situation at all. Most people who get better from drug addiction are a very positive influence. But obviously there are some celebrities who have probably contributed to people using drugs, because they make it look glamorous, they make it look interesting, and I don’t suppose that helps. While they are using they will tend to do that, but if they stop using then they obviously become a very positive role model. I do think there are some celebrities who have made the matter worse. I don’t think on a national scale it has made a huge difference. There are one or two people who are influenced by that, but I don’t think it is a—

[Russell Brand]
No. Who cares about bloody celebrities?

[Lorraine Fullbrook]
As the Chief Executive of Focus, how do you pick your celebrities?

[Chip Somers]
The ones that get clean, I will grab them.

Chair: Thank you, very helpful.

[Nicola Blackwood
Firstly, I would like to congratulate you on your work on abstinence-based work. I think that it is very effective and I share your suspicion about longterm methadone maintenance. But I was struck by your comments about the problems of highlighting drug use in communities. Do you think that we are doing enough, or do you think that there is a risk that our harm reduction-based approaches to drugs education are giving a false impression that there are some drugs that are safe if they are used correctly?

[Chip Somers]
We are not doing anything like enough to give an honest answer to the problems of drugs, and I think we are giving a rather clouded message about drug use. There is a lot more that we could be doing about honestly educating people about drugs. I don’t think we address it or take it on board properly enough.Yes, I feel that we should be doing much more. Especially at an education level, we should be giving honest education and I don’t think there are many schools that are giving honest education to young people. We have been educating young people now for 15 years and it has not had a major influence on the number of drug users. We need to change how we are doing the education of young people, particularly.

[Nicola Blackwood]
How?

[Chip Somers]
By giving more honest information. It is no good just going into schools and saying, “drugs are bad. Stop it”. Because in each of those schools there will be people who are using cannabis, who are using ketamine, who are using ecstasy. Not all the schools but some of them will be. If you don’t give people both the good and the bad of drug use they will not listen to you. There are lots of people in schools who are smoking cannabis and not dropping dead. You have to give both the positive and the negative side of it, and I don’t think we are doing that. We are giving too much of the negative side of it and not giving honest
information. People won’t listen unless it is honest.

[Dr. Huppert]
Mr Somers, you are an advocate for abstinence-based approaches.

[Chip Somers]
Very much so.

[Dr. Huppert]
You presumably know there has been work by Professor Strang, published in The Lancet—

[Chip Somers]
Yes.

[Dr. Huppert]
—which showed that there was good evidence for methadone maintenance and very high cost effectiveness, fairly good for heroin maintenance, and a lack of evidence for abstinence. Do you think that abstinence is the answer for everybody or are you arguing that there are people for whom it is a very good option?

[Chip Somers]
I think it is an admirable aim for everybody. Not everybody can achieve it. Not everybody can give up smoking. I think there is a really good purpose for methadone usage at a certain stage. But just to park people on methadone for four to seven years and more, it is criminal, really, just to keep people locked into that addiction because methadone usage is a dependency, you are totally dependent. It has a role but I think it gets overused and we just tend to use it as a response to everything, and we don’t do enough to intervene. It would be an admirable aim for everybody. I don’t think methadone usage is a good thing. I see very few people on methadone who are leading good, stable lives. Most of the people who are using methadone are also using other drugs on top. If I saw it producing good stability I would be much more in favour of it. I don’t see that. What I do see is that people who are abstinent lead good, clean and decent lives, but obviously not everybody can achieve it.

[Dr. Huppert]
I think that suggests further research is needed to check the results.

[Chip Somers]
Yes.

[Dr. Huppert]
Can I also ask both of you. Obviously, we have finite resources to spend. If we are going to spend more money on treatment, and if we are going to spend more money on education, money has to be taken from somewhere. One possible suggestion is that we spend less money on doing the policing of possession, for example. Is that something that you would support or would you see things in a different way?

[Russell Brand]
I think that is a brilliant idea, as a matter of fact, and I think there are people within the criminal justice services that share that view. Yes, you have to appropriate these resources from somewhere, and—as has already been brought up in here, mate—penalising people for the possession of drugs is costly and expensive. A good number of the times I was arrested was simply for possession, and the administrative costs of that, yes, would be better spent on education and treatment. I think that would be a very, very sensible use of those redirected funds.

[Chair]
Mr Somers.

[Chip Somers]
I feel like I am at school now because I have forgotten the question.

[Russell Brand]
Like, do you think instead of nicking people for possession they should stick it into treatment and drugs education?

[Chair]
Thank you for that translation, Mr Brand. Mr Somers.

[Chip Somers]
There is an awful lot of money wasted on small time possession of small amounts of drugs, which are just part and parcel of the daily hustle and bustle of using. There is an awful lot of police time wasted on that. I am not saying that we should legalise it or anything, but I think if we could get rid of some of that because that sort of minor possession is part of the everyday life of being an addict. I certainly think there is a massive difference between decriminalising and legalising. It is good to treat it as a health issue, rather than a criminal issue but I am not in favour of legalising things. I think we do waste a lot of money, unfortunately, on minor possession.

[Russell Brand
You spent quite a lot of time in prison on account of possession.

[Chip Somers]
I did. Yes, I did.

[Russell Brand]
But also armed robbery to get—

[Chip Somers]
Other drugs.

[Nicola Blackwood]
There is quite a gap between education and full blown addiction and treatment for abstinence. In that gap you have first use and so on, and what you need is intervention during that period to prevent addiction. Some of that prevention is perhaps first arrest for prevention and diversion programmes. Are you suggesting that we should be removing all spending on those intermediate steps in the drugs policy?

[Chip Somers]
No, I think we should do it better.

[Lorraine Fullbrook]
I would like to ask both gentlemen, what are your views on decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs?

[Russell Brand]
Chip has already been pretty clear on the subject. I am not a legal expert but I am saying that to a drug addict the legal status is irrelevant. It is at best an inconvenience. If you need to get drugs because you are a drug addict you are going to get drugs, regardless of their legal status, so the more money you waste in administering and controlling that, you know I think there is a futility to it.

[Lorraine Fullbrook]
So would you be in favour or not?

[Russell Brand]
To tell you the truth, yes, I would. I think there is a degree of cowardice and wilful ignorance around this condition. A good many people here—if you think about it—we all know someone who is affected by alcoholism or addiction, and it is something we increasingly need to handle compassionately and pragmatically. The criminal and legal status sends the wrong message. But, as I said before, I wouldn’t start banging a drum to make drugs legal, because myself I don’t take any drugs and I don’t drink because for me they are bad. I just think we need to recognise the distinction that certain people have a condition, or a tendency, so that drugs and alcohol are going ruin their lives. We need to identify those people and offer them the correct treatment.

[Lorraine Fullbrook]
Mr. Somers, do you agree with decriminalisation or legalisation?

[Chip Somers]
There is a real argument for decriminalising it so that it gets treated like a health issue rather than a legal issue. However, I think there is a massive difference between that and legalising drugs. You will find it very difficult to justify the legal use of a lot of drugs. You can’t really justify the legal use of heroin, crack cocaine or any of those drugs. There is no medical or legal reason why people should be able to use those drugs, so I think you would be hard pressed to—

[Chair]
What about cannabis?

[Chip Somers]
Cannabis is probably the one you could make an argument for.

[Chair]
But you would not support the legalisation of cannabis?

[Chip Somers]
It is the one that you have a chance of actually putting forward an argument of justification for it. I don’t think there is any justification for the legalization—

[Lorraine Fullbrook]
If you legalise or decriminalise cannabis, you are not taking away the problem. We have seen the other end, where there is a serious organized crime issue and a narco-terrorism issue, which ruins people’s lives; I mean murders peopleand causes conflict in countries, so we are looking at the other side of this.

[Chip Somers]
I am not advocating the legalisation of cannabis. I am just saying if there was any drug at all that you could put forward an argument for legalising, cannabis is the one you have the best chance with. But how on earth do you justify the usage of heroin or crack cocaine, or anything like that at all?

[Russell Brand]
Making it illegal is not working anyway, Chip. I just think that there needs to be honesty and authenticity around this issue so that people in Parliament don’t look like they are out of touch. It is really good that you are holding this Committee, but some of this information is already accessible.

[Chair]
Thank you, final question from Mr Ellis.

[Michael Ellis]
You both referred to a preference for ignoring what you described as the more minor offending in relation to drugs. Can I suggest to you that a lot of the more minor offending leads to some of the more major offending, and that actually what one is doing, if one was to ignore those types of offences, would be to make the matter worse, both for society who is suffering under the increased levels of crime, but also for the offender who would be less likely to learn the lessons of having been arrested and be more likely to get worse.

[Chair]
Mr. Somers.

[Russell Brand]
Can I just interrupt for a bit, because otherwise it is like they are telling us what to do. Being arrested isn’t a lesson. It is just an administrative blip. You need to demonstrate an awareness of the situation. Yes, of course, in many ways the disease or the condition of addiction does exacerbate, and if you start taking drugs it is likely you will take worse drugs, and if you are taking expensive drugs you will end up committing crime. But again, mate, what we need to identify is a degree of authenticity and compassion in the way we deal with this problem, otherwise you just seem like you don’t know what you are talking about.

[Michael Ellis]
What about the victims of the crime?

[Russell Brand]
We talked about them. You can tell what party they are in from their questions, can’t you, “what about the victims of the crime?”

[Michael Ellis]
I think all parties are interested in victims of crime.

[Russell Brand]
Of course we are. That is what we are saying. We are not saying, “let’s ignore victims.""

[Chair]
I think we are running out of time. I have a final question about—

[Russell Brand]
Time is infinite. We cannot run out of time.

[Chair]
It is. But for this Committee, I am afraid—

[Russell Brand
Who is next? Theresa May? She may not show up. Check she knows what day it is.

[Chair]
Mr. Brand, I have a final question for you.

[Mr. Winnick]
It is not quite a variety show, Mr Brand.

[Russell Brand]
You are providing a little bit of variety, though. You are making it more like Dad’s Army.

[Chair]
Mr. Brand, you have 4.5 million Twitter followers—

[Russell Brand]
Oh yes.

[Chair]
—and 1.5 Facebook followers. Having gone through addiction and then rehabilitation, what is your message to young people who want to get involved in drugs? What would you say to them about the effects that it has?

[Russell Brand]
My message isn’t for young people. My message is for people that have this condition of addiction. If you have the condition of addiction there is help available for you, and I recommend abstinence-based recovery. Some people can safely take drugs, I think they can. As long as it doesn’t turn them into criminals, or harm their health, then I don’t feel like it is any of my business. I am not here to do some “Just Say No” stuff. The kids that sung that “Just Say No” were all taking drugs in the White House when they were visiting Nancy Reagan. It is a further demonstration of the disjunct between reality and authenticity. Let’s have an authentic, truthful, honest debate and some funding for abstinencebased recovery.

[Chair]
Mr. Somers, do you have anything to add to that with the excellent work you are doing in your charity?

[Chip Somers]
I get very muddled in all the kind of legalisation and decriminalization. What I tend to do is deal with the problem when it exists. I agree completely that when those people come in for treatment they have damaged a lot of people in the public. They are harming at least four or five other people in their families, who are significantly distressed by that behaviour. I try and prevent that, and I think the best way of preventing that on a longterm basis is ultimately abstinence treatment. That is when you stop causing harm to families, stop causing harm to the public. That is your best chance, because at the moment I see people who are not in abstinence programmes still continuing to cause distress to families and the public.

[Chair]
Mr. Somers, Mr. Brand, thank you very much.

[Russell Brand]
Thanks for having us.

[Chip Somers]
Thank you.

[Chair]
We are most grateful, and thank you for your written evidence.",148807,en,en,en,good morning mr brand good morning please have a seat mr brand mr somers thank you for giving evidence to the committees inquiry into drugs mr russell brand you gave written evidence to this committee which members of the committee have read could i start with a point about what you say in your evidence that you disagree with the legalisation of drugs because you think that a deterrent effect is necessary is that right i dont feel entirely qualified to talk about legislation for me what is more significant is the way that we socially regard the condition of addiction it is something that i consider to be an illness and therefore more a health matter than a criminal or judicial matter as i said i dont think legalisation is something that i am particularly qualified to get into in fact i can see areas where decriminalisation might be considered useful and more efficient in countries like portugal or switzerland where there have been trials it seems to have had some efficacy but for me it is more important that we regard people suffering from addiction with compassion and that there is a pragmatic rather than symbolic approach to treating it the legislative status of addiction and the criminalisation of addicts is kind of symbolic and not really functional i dont see how it especially helps but i am not saying lets have a wacky freeforall let people go around taking drugs it didnt help me much you are a former heroin addict yes briefly could you tell us how you got on to drugs and then how you managed to come off it and how many years you were on hard drugs i see you have incorporated the word briefly now into the question as you already know it is my propensity for verbosity i became a drug addict i think because of emotional difficulties psychological difficulties and perhaps a spiritual malady for me taking drugs and excessive drinking were the result of a psychological spiritual or mental condition so they are symptomatic i was sad lonely unhappy and detached and drugs and alcohol for me seemed like a solution to that problem once i dealt with the emotional spiritual mental impetus i no longer felt the need to take drugs or use drugs actually i got clean at chip somers facility focus which is abstinencebased recovery that is what we essentially believe in if you have the disease or the illness of addiction or alcoholism the best way to tackle it is to not use drugs in any form whether it is statesponsored opiates like methadone or illegal street drugs or a legal substance like alcohol we see no distinction between these substances what we believe in is that abstinencebased recovery is the best solution for people suffering from this condition and that support structures exist to get people to maintain recoveryabstinencebased recovery what we want is more research and funding into abstinencebased recovery and to be able to filter people towards this new lifestyle where actually criminalisation becomes less of an issue in my view because it takes people that have to indulge in criminal activity to fund their habits and gets them into being valuable members of society was that brief enough very brief thank you you were arrested roughly times it was rough yes by the police and the justice system do you think that when you were arrested that you had the kind of support that you needed and people like you who were arrested being involved in drugs the rehabilitation and the support that was needed to get you off drugs how did the criminal justice system react to you after your arrests from my experience speaking to people in the criminal justice system and from my own personal experience being arrested there is some confusion and ignorance around addiction that is quite understandable because a lot of drug addictsspeaking personallyare antisocial they are a strain on society they necessarily engage in criminal activity they are a public nuisance in many waysi felt when i was arrested that the police were doing a necessary job of enforcing the laws of this country and that they were doing what they had to do it wasnt until i had access to abstinencebased recovery that i was able to change my behaviour and significantly reduceall but obliteratemy criminal activity apart from the occasional skirmish the final question from me on this section is the issue of legal highs we have been very concerned in the evidence that we have received about the number of legal highs that are available and young people who seem to be able to take legal highs whenever they are banned or proposed to be banned a new legal high emerges do you think this is something that does affect young people is this now the drug of choice for young people i dont know because i am not young enough anymore i know that young people will always want to get high and i think that what we need is a pragmatic approach to this for me in a wayas i said before keithit is not significant the substance they are using whether it is alcohol or illegal street drugs the legal status of a drug is irrelevant to a drug addict if you are a drug addict you are getting drugs thats it you are going to get them so in a way it is probably best to make it simple as for legal highs what i think we need to do is address the social mental and spiritual problems that are leading young people or people of all ages into taking drugs so i think what we need is research into abstinencebased recovery and more awareness around it we will come on to some of those points with other questions you are currently working on a programme about addiction and how it is viewed in society what messages are you hoping to get across in that programme the messages that we are hoping to get across in this programme is that maintenance of drug addiction through statesponsored substances like methadone should only be deployed as part of a reduction with the ultimate aim of abstinencebased recovery that we need to start regarding addiction in all its forms as a health issue as opposed to a judicial and criminal issue that we need to change the laws in this country that we need to have more compassionate altruistic loving attitudes to the people with the disease of addiction and recognise that these people with the proper help and access to the proper treatment can become active and helpful members of society like myselfsome would argue that pointor perhaps more obviously chip somers a man with a criminal record as long as your arm who now runs a treatment centre and has been clean for years that is the message that we dont want to discard people we dont want to life them off on methadone and leave them on the sidelines we need to bring them into society offer them treatment and once again neutralise the toxic social threat that they offer as criminals because they have to fund their habit or even if it is a legal drug like alcohol they are clattering into things driving drunk pain in the arse people we need to offer them treatment and activate them and incorporate them into our society so the message is ultimately one of pragmatism altruism and compassion in all areas of the condition thank you mr somers we will have specific questions for you but if you want to chip inif i may put it like thatat any stage please feel free to do so is there anything you want to add to what you have heard so far i think he is doing splendidly thanks chip chip runs the treatment centre where i got clean so yes we are coming on to him in a minute mr brand he is already the puppeteer behind each and every articulation thank you mr brand mr brand you have said that addiction is an illness yes would you say that it is also fair to characterise it as selfinduced to a large extent unlike many other illnesses not really also that it does carry with it victims many people who are on drugs commit offences against other people do they not so it differs in that respect as well doesnt it when one is looking at the criminal justice system doesnt one also have to have some compassion and consideration for the victims of crime where those crimes are committed by people under the influence of drugs michael i am very glad you have asked me that question it is a very important question and it is one that we need to address of course the victims of acquisitive drugrelated crimes are important and need to be taken care of we were with chief superintendent graham bartlett of sussex police the other day a wonderful man a good civic minded gentleman it is his belief that by regarding addiction as an illness by offering treatment instead of a more punitive approach we can prevent people from committing crimes just personally i was a criminal when i was drug addict by virtue of my addiction and the ways that i had to acquire money to get drugs anecdotally chip was an armed robber in and out of nick all the timei hope you dont mind me telling them thisand other people i have met you know criminality is a necessary component of course we are not saying forget the victims but i am saying it is better to address the social situation pragmatically i think we all know this by prescribing methadone to people most people on methadone are using illegal drugs to supplement their habit they are not addressing the root problems we need to approach the victims with respect where there has been criminal behaviour it needs to be dealt with correctly but perhaps within the penal system itself we can offer treatment to addicts like the brilliant work that is done by rapt in various institutions and prisons you would say there needs to be carrot and stick would you i dont think there needs to be a carrot or a stick both of those things are like bizarre metaphors what there needs to be is love and compassion for everybody involved if people are committing criminal behaviour then it needs to be dealt with legally but you need to offer them treatment not simply out of some airy fairy lets hold hands and hug liberalism but because it deals with the problem and it prevents further crimes being committed addicts that get clean one day at a time through abstinencebased recovery generally speaking stop committing crimes that is better for victims it is better for the addicts it is better for society the role that celebrities play in society is not insignificant i want to ask you whether i would argue that it is insignificant and that is why they play that role perhaps it should be more than it is but what i want to know from you mr brand is whether having got out of the cycle of addiction and i congratulate you for that thank you you would like to position yourself as a role model in society for those who might look to you as an example as the great pac shakur said role is something people play model is something that people make both of those things are fake what i want to offer people is truth and authenticity in the treatment of this illness in our regard to the criminal components of it in assisting victims and in the way we legislate and organise our society as you know i cant be responsibleyou lot hold committees all the time about the reprehensible behaviour of our mediawhat the cipher of my image is used to represent in the media i have no control over you do forgive me you do because your behaviour is some aspect of what is portrayed about you isnt it yes of course but how is this going to be written up this could be written up as michael ellis is sprawled on a pin there by the wit of brand or they could say recalcitrant former drug addict rambled on if you read it in the telegraph it is going to say one thing if you read it in the socialist worker it is going to say another thing it probably will be a combination of course the objective behaviour has components but i am saying that what i want to offer people is truth and authenticity celebrity as we all know is a vapid vacuous toxic concept used to distract people from what is actually important and in this case that is the treatment of people with the disease of addiction yes mr somers as far as we were concerned those people who are brave enough who are both celebrities and recovering addicts have a profound effect on the number of people who seek treatment because it gives out a very positive message that recovery is possible when russell brands book came out the number of referrals to our treatment centre was just hugely exaggerated because people suddenly discovered that treatment was possible help was possible and people could get better and it made a profound difference i would hope that actually more people in the public eyewell i suppose being celebrities they are in the public eyewill come forward and have the bravery to do so because it does encourage people so celebrities can be a very positive role model absolutely of course then it can backfire as well when people make a big fuss about being in recovery and then relapse that is unfortunate but we are fortunate with russell that he is maintaining a good recovery and that continues to be a good role model mr brand do you think more people need to know about things like cocaine production and where cocaine comes from the committee went to colombia to look at the effects that the harvesting of cocaine was having on the people of colombia who are extraordinarily poor and were forced to be involved in this kind of activity do you think if there were more focus on where it all came from and how it affected communities that would help to stop people getting involved russell brand no keith no more than the industrial consequences of oil production affect people using their cars people dont care about industry people care about getting the resource that they require the illegality makes no difference the consequences in the nation of origin make no difference what we need is to address the emotional mental and spiritual problems that lead to addiction of course any illegal industry or the cocaine manufacture in south american nations or wherever has a negative consequence for their nations but i dont think that that is something that individual drug addicts are going to be affected by to be honest because they are normally on drugs i would like to ask a question to mr somers focus has three high profile patrons mr brand davina mccall and boy george that is something that was probably unthinkable about years ago do you think that has led to the destigmatisation of addiction or do you think it has led to a wider acceptance of drug use in society generally i dont think it has encouraged people to use drugs i think there have been some people who have made a positive this lady has to get by sorry love i was right in the middle of my answer then still a good speech there were just some ladies going by i think the public is fine yes mr somers do you know i have completely forgotten where i was that is because he was flirting with them two it was about high profile patrons and destigmatisation or does it lead to a wider acceptance yes there are certain celebrities who have made a positive message about drug use it has not helped the situation at all most people who get better from drug addiction are a very positive influence but obviously there are some celebrities who have probably contributed to people using drugs because they make it look glamorous they make it look interesting and i dont suppose that helps while they are using they will tend to do that but if they stop using then they obviously become a very positive role model i do think there are some celebrities who have made the matter worse i dont think on a national scale it has made a huge difference there are one or two people who are influenced by that but i dont think it is a no who cares about bloody celebrities as the chief executive of focus how do you pick your celebrities the ones that get clean i will grab them chair thank you very helpful nicola blackwood firstly i would like to congratulate you on your work on abstinencebased work i think that it is very effective and i share your suspicion about longterm methadone maintenance but i was struck by your comments about the problems of highlighting drug use in communities do you think that we are doing enough or do you think that there is a risk that our harm reductionbased approaches to drugs education are giving a false impression that there are some drugs that are safe if they are used correctly we are not doing anything like enough to give an honest answer to the problems of drugs and i think we are giving a rather clouded message about drug use there is a lot more that we could be doing about honestly educating people about drugs i dont think we address it or take it on board properly enoughyes i feel that we should be doing much more especially at an education level we should be giving honest education and i dont think there are many schools that are giving honest education to young people we have been educating young people now for years and it has not had a major influence on the number of drug users we need to change how we are doing the education of young people particularly how by giving more honest information it is no good just going into schools and saying drugs are bad stop it because in each of those schools there will be people who are using cannabis who are using ketamine who are using ecstasy not all the schools but some of them will be if you dont give people both the good and the bad of drug use they will not listen to you there are lots of people in schools who are smoking cannabis and not dropping dead you have to give both the positive and the negative side of it and i dont think we are doing that we are giving too much of the negative side of it and not giving honest information people wont listen unless it is honest mr somers you are an advocate for abstinencebased approaches very much so you presumably know there has been work by professor strang published in the lancet yes which showed that there was good evidence for methadone maintenance and very high cost effectiveness fairly good for heroin maintenance and a lack of evidence for abstinence do you think that abstinence is the answer for everybody or are you arguing that there are people for whom it is a very good option i think it is an admirable aim for everybody not everybody can achieve it not everybody can give up smoking i think there is a really good purpose for methadone usage at a certain stage but just to park people on methadone for four to seven years and more it is criminal really just to keep people locked into that addiction because methadone usage is a dependency you are totally dependent it has a role but i think it gets overused and we just tend to use it as a response to everything and we dont do enough to intervene it would be an admirable aim for everybody i dont think methadone usage is a good thing i see very few people on methadone who are leading good stable lives most of the people who are using methadone are also using other drugs on top if i saw it producing good stability i would be much more in favour of it i dont see that what i do see is that people who are abstinent lead good clean and decent lives but obviously not everybody can achieve it i think that suggests further research is needed to check the results yes can i also ask both of you obviously we have finite resources to spend if we are going to spend more money on treatment and if we are going to spend more money on education money has to be taken from somewhere one possible suggestion is that we spend less money on doing the policing of possession for example is that something that you would support or would you see things in a different way i think that is a brilliant idea as a matter of fact and i think there are people within the criminal justice services that share that view yes you have to appropriate these resources from somewhere andas has already been brought up in here matepenalising people for the possession of drugs is costly and expensive a good number of the times i was arrested was simply for possession and the administrative costs of that yes would be better spent on education and treatment i think that would be a very very sensible use of those redirected funds mr somers i feel like i am at school now because i have forgotten the question like do you think instead of nicking people for possession they should stick it into treatment and drugs education thank you for that translation mr brand mr somers there is an awful lot of money wasted on small time possession of small amounts of drugs which are just part and parcel of the daily hustle and bustle of using there is an awful lot of police time wasted on that i am not saying that we should legalise it or anything but i think if we could get rid of

difficult justify legal use lot drugs cant really justify legal use heroin crack cocaine drugs medical legal reason people able use drugs think would hard pressed cannabis cannabis probably one could make argument would support legalisation cannabis one chance actually putting forward argument justification dont think justification legalization legalise decriminalise cannabis taking away problem seen end serious organized crime issue narcoterrorism issue ruins peoples lives mean murders peopleand causes conflict countries looking side advocating legalisation cannabis saying drug could put

parliament dont look like touch really good holding committee information already accessible thank final question mr ellis referred preference ignoring described minor offending relation drugs suggest lot minor offending leads major offending actually one one ignore types offences would make matter worse society suffering increased levels crime also offender would less likely learn lessons arrested likely get worse mr somers interrupt bit otherwise like telling us arrested isnt lesson administrative blip need demonstrate awareness situation yes course many ways disease condition addiction

I keep a rocket in my back pocket
I blast atomic
Rain down like a comet
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
You can’t stop it
Microphone getting so hot I’ma drop it
But it’s burning hotter than the sun
So I’m leaving nothing but ashes in my palm when I’m done

Out here in this thin zone
Trying to phone home
But my signal’s scrambled
Trying to get a handle
But to make an omelette you gotta break a few eggs
Watch me upstage my enemies
Poison stinging like the tentacles of an anemone
One day I’ll make the shadow pay
But it steady stays ahead of me

PAYBACK,pop,PRIZM AA,2020,73,{},"(CHORUS)
You kissed me on my face then moved way back
But the acne on my pants doesn't say that
Its kinda like you put a tick beside payback
But you smiled when I called out your name
I don't know how you feel and I hate that
Thought you were holding down, Need my faith back
If it isn't mutual then ill lay back
Ill lay back
If this isn't true, why'd you lead me (On, Hey)
Put a knife in my back for no reason (Why)
I am cool, you were cold like the seasons
Can't believe that you still walked away
Put a hole in my heart couldn't save that
Everytime im alone, man I hate that
Did I do something wrong, I need a playback
Need a playback

(VERSE 1)
Cold seasons, Closed stores, We're freezing
Thought I cuffed you, No men were thieving
But more blessings, Thank god for Jesus
You were lonely, Crazy Mamacita
I like my older women but you destroyed that preference
I was 16 when I seen her
Guess I learned a lesson, I will never forget this
Dont mess with your ex or her people
Its a cycle, Never ending crisis
Im in that new Y-3, check out the prices
17, Big dreams, Nice whips
Maybelline, Her head game, The nicest
My heart plucked to petals
I stayed calm and subtle
But inside I lost where my light is
Black garments dictate how your life is
The car swerved through lanes like Mike Tyson
But still I try to drive when im stuck
Instead of taking time just to vibe in the cut, I'll rush
I'd take you out for time but this time you cut
I figured you weren't matching my vibe
Came out of line, I had to stand to this side
Tryna figure out when Id be passing her by
Then I recognized that I was stashing my life
Tryna live a lie, I was attached to her mind
(BRIDGE)
You just like to act like you need me (Hey, hey, hey)
You see my potential fore' you see me
You just see my name, You don't see me
In the dark, but you still throw the shade
I should've kept it calm, Should've layed back (Hey, hey, hey)
All the times you did me wrong, Imma play it back
Don't hold me down when its time for payback
For my payback
Ill leave a hole where your heart is, Save that
Everytime you're alone, you're gonna hate that
Did me wrong, now your asking for a playback (Playback)

(PRE-CHORUS)
You just like to act like you need me ( Hey)
You see my potential fore' you see me (Hey)
You just see me name, You don't see me (Hey)
You dont see me
Hey hey hey
Just don't forget

You kissed me on my face then moved way back
But the acne on my pants doesn't say that
Its kinda like you put a tick beside payback
But you smiled when I called out your name
I don't know how you feel and I hate that
I wanted to hold you like a wavecap
If it isn't mutual then ill lay back
Ill lay back, Ill lay back
If this isn't true, why'd you lead me (On)
Put a knife in my back for no reason

His motorcycle injuries won't make him unforgettable
He's like a firework display that's been doused in her rain

Upon her preference she can rearrange the structure his bones
He knows he's for the sewer when her laughter's like a drain
But the only lovers worth a damn
Are the long term lovers of pain

She would find him at her elbow buying parma ham and cheese
And she knew her scant encouragement would bring him to his knees
She resented these new powers, felt his passion pulled her reins

And the kitchen floor was voted down for a mattress full of hay

Sittin' in the bar, playing Keno on a Wednesday
Pumpin' quarters in the jukebox, MJ
Rockin' Billie Jean, Jilly nodding off, silly
Sniffin' thirty millie beans, wet-brain Willy
Flippin' out, what's he really mean?
I can't hear him, he's incoherent mmmmmm
Between the swearing and the staring, Sharon a cokey-eyed spooky chick
Kinda crackhead-ish
Bitch got middle-aged hips and a black fetish
Tapping a Newpie ash
I caught a buzz with her, starin' at her groupie ass
Doin' drugs with her, she spoke of a kindergartener
Sipping whiskey, telling me that he'll get into Harvard
I been a part of it to benefit demented hardship
The streets that I grew on ruined by the scent of garbage
What am I doin' here? I can't escape this place
I'm trapped staring in the mirror, standing face-to-face
I don't really need the things I do not have
Where I'm from, when they shoot at you, you shot back
Everybody knows  I rose and it's not bad
But now I'm back in a bar room on Dot Ave
[Hook: Rite Hook]
Oh! Here I am
Back in the same place again
Do you wanna know
Where I been?
Or where I'm gonna go?
And when I find my way
Tell me where to follow

[Verse 2: Slaine]
Dorchester, where they pack burners in the whore's fest
More or less, I store four fours up in my drawers
Filled with pills, yayo, bullets, warm cans of Coors
Yesterday's wars, burnt bridges of festering thoughts
In the honor of excellence
Commit seven sins, I live next to hell where heaven ends
I murder stories from purgatory and prisoners
Dead cultures are twisted in this frigid religiousness
Scriptures in the hood, wooden shovels to dig a ditch
Figaro, they treat me like a negro who's getting rich
I take a swig 'n swish whiskey, I'm a bit intense
So maybe I'ma product of this ignorance
It sticks with me, my church is full of serpents
I jerk the curtains closed, this time I'm certain
The police is lurking, I'm out of work again

On Solid Ground,pop,Rhonda Vincent,2001,412,{},"Darlin we've been through some hard times
And regrets I've had a few
I gave my best to make you happy
It wasn't good enough for you
So today its all over
I'll be seeing you around
I'm standing up and stepping over
Moving on to solid ground
Cause life's about choices and I've made a few
To start living for myself now and honey not for you
But you better get it straight now I ain't leaving this town
Baby from now on I'll be standing on solid ground

You taught me life is what you make it
That's a simple line but true
But when it comes to how you're living
The choice is really up to you
Keep your eye upon tomorrow
Live your dreams and make em last
Take the time to smell the roses
And learn a lesson from the past
(chorus)
So darling thank you for the good times
Tears will never need to fall
It's not the end it's the beginning
Of a new day after all
I'll just try to keep my head high
Even when they get me down
I'll take a stand and keep on standing
High upon the solid ground

Oh, I’m pilling myself for you
You enjoy watching me bleed
And these numbers
Are proving eulogiеs currency too
Cause if evеn half of these people
Pop out to my funeral
I’ll feel totally cool and safe then
You fake friend, you headache
You stressed out, no talent
Parental mistake
Please get out of your damn brain
And pick up your phone
Before I worry if you’re still awake
Please—you’re killing us

Breaking through the seals of fate

Evergreen,rap,Lil Seyi,2020,382,{},"Previously the leaf took a leave, And he grieved the loss
No way to justify the pride inside If he decides the cross is mercy
Pick up the stones there they go, They let the lemon know
Why they alone, issa show, Request for battered bones
They ready to throw, Then he shows, he let the judges know
I'm not alone, I arose, He said your case is closed

I always find my way back to lord, Please, lord forgive me
I just want to be your evergreen
God knows I can’t afford another fall, I’m so done with these rotations
Grant me patience to be evergreen

God talk
Faith talk
Religious talk
Church
Consume the gospel like vehicles and the fuel from fossils
Reach the highway driving stable not a single wobble
Then the throttle ceases to function im driving forward
Revert to my mortal bones, to push luggage that I call home
I stumble, I break my bones, its swollen
Do you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
Stuff that I've been through prolly an issue If it happens more than once
Things I got into, things I got used to, all along I knew I was wrong
Feeling like de ja vu, and I'm the king and i'm so high, you can’t tell me
I’m coming down like I’m A.P. then I fall down and bruise my knees
Then I repent, and you forgive, I slip, to the back I slid
Crying give me a new heart, I don’t wanna hurt you again
Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean
I always find my way back to lord, Please, lord forgive me
I just want to be your evergreen
God knows I can’t afford another fall, I’m so done with these rotations
Grant me patience to be evergreen

I am
I am the higher power the hours the moon the showers
The breath, the soul, the plasma, The mind, the laws, the lambda
The stem, the root, the flower, My tower, will soon devour
My kingdom will surely come
Acquainted now with my ID I hope you take into perspective
All of those affected, when you were being reckless
And there’s nothing too small because I can always detect it
Maybe not from your perspective but I see you’re all connected
I know all your true intentions, I know what you’ve been googling
I know everything, I know the lies to mom isn’t true
And see, I still love you
Yeshua died so we can be together, Like a feather, you drift away, like a leaf
But not
You see you are the tree, I am the leaf, You cut me off
In low degrees, Deciduous, Not evergreen
Distinction is simple you see
Grow your roots, Can't drive the distance without the nozzle
I know your heart is truly changed, But they already hostile

Pick up the stones there they go, They let the lemon know
Why they alone, issa show, Request for battered bones

Started popping pills with no description
I think our love is slowly drifting
I hope you call my name in the next existence
I blame it on the distance
I fell in love with the wrong mistress

God damn

Still hear your name when i sleep
Thinking it’s a bad dream
I hope you hear me when i scream
The scars i hide is way to deep

I keep on falling in this black hole
Holding on to broken rope
I’m reaching out for hope
Sorry that I’m running to the dope
I cannot cope
My only friend is coke
And every time i take a sniff
I push me to the cliff
Push me to the edge
All my roses dead
It’s the end of days her rose is growing in my brain
Insane

Stealing Electricity,pop,Tom Russell,2007,1012,{},"There's a Mexican dead on a power line

D-da, d-da, d-da, d-da, d-da

Religion i guess.,rap,Dech and Musi,2021,21,{},"[Verse 1]
12 battered in my door report it as a bad knock
Sad shock, when they saw their wives splayed and spatchcocked
Red heads, matchbox, and I’m butt nekkid in some dad crocs
Gettin’ grilled about some crack rocks
Only base I discuss is home plate
Got grown mates waitin’, thank God I made the drone late
Stone faced, Rushmore, why da fuck would I rush for?
Charisma +4
Deck stacked for me like a bus tour
Fireproof lab, lyrical arson
Thinkin’ 10 steps ahead like Magnus Carlsen
Shogi not chess
Show thee? Not yet
Eager to be enlightenеd, eightfold not met

Strap the fuck in Alеc, god why’d I do this...

[Verse 2]
Sauntering samsara
What’s a shmuck gotta do for some damn karma
Bomb Yemen like Obama?
Suck dick and fry chicken parmas?
Let’s ask the Dalai Lama
Alpaca two Tec if I hafta, ain’t no trolley problem
Golly pardon
Issa moral dilemma
Guess I should hashtag Breonna Taylor’s name more than Jidenna
Is that the right resolve?
Gettin’ Boddhisatvas involved? (I dunno)
Feels a lot like appropriation
Gotta figure the Rohingya know truths of the holy nation
I’m eager to hear the Uigurs, that’s a meager request
How many morons to read a Quran at an Imam’s behest?
You loony? Soon the Sunnis gon’ put truth bombs to the test
Eviscerate the ignorance and incur calm to the mess
Inshallah we burn the palms, cuz the Psalms will attest
That faith is genocide at worst and bad drama at best
I’m not too woke for the folklore, I could rap bout coke whores
Rather rap bout Pope whores
It suits me, I bespoke more (nah nah fuck that)
Team Jacob you bitches, sheep’s clothing taylor made
Chambermaids clams clamorin’ for the juice like Gatorade
Got ‘em howling, prowling
This werewolf is dire
Ghost rider, crossbone roof, hoof on fire
Rapidash, so the mane too
You adopted the dark, call me Bane 2 (nah nah fuck that)

Sneakin’ into Winterfell, surreptitious splinter cell Thought it was Black Ops chat the way them n****rs fell
More blood spilled than some HBO shit on Comcast
Throne ain’t a game to me, call it a Stark contrast

[Bridge]
Just stay on task
Hella nonsequitir, mind is so secular
No higher guidance, thoughts far from regular
Just do better

[Verse 3]
Exhaust all my wisdom while I’m burnin’ some sage
Imagine the mage squarin’ up with squires and pages
26 Middle Age, burn bright with brittle rage
Can’t fathom my light years, distance a riddle gauge
Caught me in 4K? Ok issa deep fake
Pump the E-brake
Think I’m lackin’, that’s a sleep take
Bust out the duster, take your chances with the sweepstakes
Got it out the mud, hard enough to make ya cleats break
Hole in the wall joint, eat wings and fit a brick
Lit a clip, slapped some salivatin’ tongues then hit a lick
Bloodwork, pop a vein, little prick
Splatter painting with the Blick
.44 Magnum Opus
Acrylic on canvas
Hood expressionist lays low in Wichita, Kansas
Shocker
Beware the ides of March Madness
Rides through sunflower fields with a nun marked Agnes
Canonized, controversy sanitized
Calcutta photo ops, cameras flashin’ in her manic eyes
Vatican Could panic, or hand it to satanic ties
Sermon on the mount, fracking into granite lies
Therein lies that
Planets die slow but the soul will wander
Hive mind cloud as the snow kills sonder
Live from the Styx
Eternity of flowing mystery
Live from the Sticks
With Annie Wilkes sowing Misery
Live from the Sticks
How I articulate artillery
My prize is a Twix
And several picks on the auxiliary
The stu' is a distillery
Stewin’ up spirits
The one true Religion but nobody wanna hear it

Yall Dont Wanna Step to Dis,rock,Against Me!,2001,2921,{},"[Verse 1]
Four sins past sainthood, it's like I'm dying to forget
All the sleepless nights lying perfectly alone and still
I can drink 'till victory, I'll drink to the mighty
Drink until I die or at least until the sunrise

When honesty, as popular as a plague, comes to remind me
The dead's winning the race with me going nowhere
Right down the street a prostitute is selling
The closest thing to love that this country has to offer

[Chorus]
And Alachua still sleeps tonight
And Alachua still sleeps tonight
And Alachua still sleeps tonight

[Verse 2]
So we fought for the republic
While the Catholic sun filled every eye
From the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean
Victory, I'll drink to the mighty
We died for oil, we died for borders
Killed for democracy, still believed every platform

Can you handle the death
Accept what we create together?
I still know every politician
Is a fucking monster

Culture kills bureaucrats
And all other undesirables
History said we died for freedom
But today no justice was served

[Chorus]
And America still sleeps tonight
And America still sleeps tonight
And America still sleeps tonight
And I hope it doesn't wake up tomorrow

[Verse 3]
So we boasted that we were champions
Each country singing its own praise
Like a rock thrown into the ocean
Humanity was rising to the top, two world wars later
Countless military interventions
We erect monuments to history
And give apologies to the dead
All that was fought for the living is quickly forgotten
We don't remember the dates
We don't remember the reasons
We have no idea what's going on
Building histories of western corporations

It doesn't even turn my stomach
To see the pictures of atrocities anymore
Going numb in the new order
Of the new century

And America still sleeps tonight
And the world still sleeps tonight...

This is rock bottom baby
Knock knock
Lost in a soft autumn, hazy
Pop the lock off the safety
These rotten thoughts often cause losses lately
Held hostage to this hot-headed monster momma raised
See every day's another-
Every day's another I don't know
Pushing on that pavement while you're looking for that pot of gold
Winning fights and then forgetting what you fought them for
Waiting for that maybe and then praying that it's not a no
See the difference is our differences are not the same
Certified cynic, grin and listen while you drop a name
Man why you fishing for that pocket change

Let All Be As Thought It Had Never Been,misc,Anthony Trollope,1873,2,{},"Between her son, and her married daughter, and Lucy Morris, poor Lady Fawn's life had become a burthen to her. Everything was astray, and there was no happiness or tranquillity at Fawn Court. Of all simply human creeds the strongest existing creed for the present in the minds of the Fawn ladies was that which had reference to the general iniquity of Lizzie Eustace. She had been the cause of all these sorrows, and she was hated so much the more because she had not been proved to be iniquitous before all the world. There had been a time when it seemed to be admitted that she was so wicked in keeping the diamonds in opposition to the continued demands made for them by Mr. Camperdown, that all people would be justified in dropping her, and Lord Fawn among the number. But since the two robberies, public opinion had veered round three or four points in Lizzie's favour, and people were beginning to say that she had been ill-used. Then had come Mrs. Hittaway's evidence as to Lizzie's wicked doings down in Scotland,—the wicked doings which Andy Gowran had described with a vehemence so terribly moral; and that which had been at first, as it were, added to the diamonds, as a supplementary weight thrown into the scale, so that Lizzie's iniquities might bring her absolutely to the ground, had gradually assumed the position of being the first charge against her. Lady Fawn had felt no aversion to discussing the diamonds. When Lizzie was called a ""thief,"" and a ""robber,"" and a ""swindler"" by one or another of the ladies of the family,—who, in using those strong terms, whispered the words as ladies are wont to do when they desire to lessen the impropriety of the strength of their language by the gentleness of the tone in which the words are spoken,—when Lizzie was thus described in Lady Fawn's hearing in her own house, she had felt no repugnance to it. It was well that the fact should be known, so that everybody might be aware that her son was doing right in refusing to marry so wicked a lady. But when the other thing was added to it; when the story was told of what Mr. Gowran had seen among the rocks, and when gradually that became the special crime which was to justify her son in dropping the lady's acquaintance, then Lady Fawn became very unhappy, and found the subject to be, as Mrs. Hittaway had described it, very distasteful.

And this trouble hit Lucy Morris as hard as it did Lord Fawn. If Lizzie Eustace was unfit to marry Lord Fawn because of these things, then was Frank Greystock not only unfit to marry Lucy, but most unlikely to do so, whether fit or unfit. For a week or two Lady Fawn had allowed herself to share Lucy's joy, and to believe that Mr. Greystock would prove himself true to the girl whose heart he had made all his own;—but she had soon learned to distrust the young member of Parliament who was always behaving insolently to her son, who spent his holidays down with Lizzie Eustace, who never visited and rarely wrote to the girl he had promised to marry, and as to whom all the world agreed in saying that he was far too much in debt to marry any woman who had not means to help him. It was all sorrow and vexation together; and yet when her married daughter would press the subject upon her, and demand her co-operation, she had no power of escaping. ""Mamma,"" Mrs. Hittaway had said, ""Lady Glencora Palliser has been with her, and everybody is taking her up, and if her conduct down in Scotland isn't proved, Frederic will be made to marry her."" ""But what can I do, my dear?"" Lady Fawn had asked, almost in tears. ""Insist that Frederic shall know the whole truth,"" replied Mrs. Hittaway with energy. ""Of course, it is very disagreeable. Nobody can feel it more than I do. It is horrible to have to talk about such things,—and to think of them."" ""Indeed it is, Clara,—very horrible."" ""But anything, mamma, is better than that Frederic should be allowed to marry such a woman as that. It must be proved to him—how unfit she is to be his wife."" With the view of carrying out this intention, Mrs. Hittaway had, as we have seen, received Andy Gowran at her own house; and with the same view she took Andy Gowran the following morning down to Richmond.

Mrs. Hittaway, and her mother, and Andy were closeted together for half an hour, and Lady Fawn suffered grievously. Lord Fawn had found that he couldn't hear the story, and he had not heard it. He had been strong enough to escape, and had, upon the whole, got the best of it in the slight skirmish which had taken place between him and the Scotchman; but poor old Lady Fawn could not escape. Andy was allowed to be eloquent, and the whole story was told to her, though she would almost sooner have been flogged at a cart's tail than have heard it. Then ""rafrashments"" were administered to Andy of a nature which made him prefer Fawn Court to Warwick Square, and he was told that he might go back to Portray as soon as he pleased.

When he was gone, Mrs. Hittaway opened her mind to her mother altogether. ""The truth is, mamma, that Frederic will marry her.""

""But why? I thought that he had declared that he would give it up. I thought that he had said so to herself.""

""What of that, if he retracts what he said? He is so weak. Lady Glencora Palliser has made him promise to go and see her; and he is to go to-day. He is there now, probably,—at this very moment. If he had been firm, the thing was done. After all that has taken place, nobody would ever have supposed that his engagement need go for anything. But what can he say to her now that he is with her, except just do the mischief all over again? I call it quite wicked in that woman's interfering. I do, indeed! She's a nasty, insolent, impertinent creature;—that's what she is! After all the trouble I've taken, she comes and undoes it all with one word.""

""What can we do, Clara?""

""Well;—I do believe that if Frederic could be made to act as he ought to do, just for a while, she would marry her cousin, Mr. Greystock, and then there would be an end of it altogether. I really think that she likes him best, and from all that I can hear, she would take him now, if Frederic would only keep out of the way. As for him, of course he is doing his very best to get her. He has not one shilling to rub against another, and is over head and ears in debt.""

""Poor Lucy!"" ejaculated Lady Fawn.

""Well;—yes; but really that is a matter of course. I always thought, mamma, that you and Amelia were a little wrong to coax her up in that belief.""

""But, my dear, the man proposed for her in the plainest possible manner. I saw his letter.""
""No doubt;—men do propose. We all know that. I'm sure I don't know what they get by it, but I suppose it amuses them. There used to be a sort of feeling that if a man behaved badly something would be done to him; but that's all over now. A man may propose to whom he likes, and if he chooses to say afterwards that it doesn't mean anything, there's nothing in the world to bring him to book.""

""That's very hard,"" said the elder lady, of whom everybody said that she did not understand the world as well as her daughter.

""The girls,—they all know that it is so, and I suppose it comes to the same thing in the long run. The men have to marry, and what one girl loses another girl gets.""

""It will kill Lucy.""

""Girls ain't killed so easy, mamma;—not now-a-days. Saying that it will kill her won't change the man's nature. It wasn't to be expected that such a man as Frank Greystock, in debt, and in Parliament, and going to all the best houses, should marry your governess. What was he to get by it? That's what I want to know.""

""I suppose he loved her.""

""Laws, mamma, how antediluvian you are! No doubt he did like her,—after his fashion; though what he saw in her, I never could tell. I think Miss Morris would make a very nice wife for a country clergyman who didn't care how poor things were. But she has no style;—and as far as I can see, she has no beauty. Why should such a man as Frank Greystock tie himself by the leg for ever to such a girl as that? But, mamma, he doesn't mean to marry Lucy Morris. Would he have been going on in that way with his cousin down in Scotland had he meant it? He means nothing of the kind. He means to marry Lady Eustace's income if he can get it;—and she would marry him before the summer if only we could keep Frederic away from her.""

Mrs. Hittaway demanded from her mother that in season and out of season she should be urgent with Lord Fawn, impressing upon him the necessity of waiting, in order that he might see how false Lady Eustace was to him; and also that she should teach Lucy Morris how vain were all her hopes. If Lucy Morris would withdraw her claims altogether the thing might probably be more quickly and more surely managed. If Lucy could be induced to tell Frank that she withdrew her claim, and that she saw how impossible it was that they should ever be man and wife, then,—so argued Mrs. Hittaway,—Frank would at once throw himself at his cousin's feet, and all the difficulty would be over. The abominable, unjustifiable, and insolent interference of Lady Glencora just at the present moment would be the means of undoing all the good that had been done, unless it could be neutralised by some such activity as this. The necklace had absolutely faded away into nothing. The sly creature was almost becoming a heroine on the strength of the necklace. The very mystery with which the robberies were pervaded was acting in her favour. Lord Fawn would absolutely be made to marry her,—forced into it by Lady Glencora and that set,—unless the love affair between her and her cousin, of which Andy Gowran was able to give such sufficient testimony, could in some way be made available to prevent it.

The theory of life and system on which social matters should be managed, as displayed by her married daughter, was very painful to poor old Lady Fawn. When she was told that under the new order of things promises from gentlemen were not to be looked upon as binding, that love was to go for nothing, that girls were to be made contented by being told that when one lover was lost another could be found, she was very unhappy. She could not disbelieve it all, and throw herself back upon her faith in virtue, constancy, and honesty. She rather thought that things had changed for the worse since she was young, and that promises were not now as binding as they used to be. She herself had married into a Liberal family, had a Liberal son, and would have called herself a Liberal; but she could not fail to hear from others, her neighbours, that the English manners, and English principles, and English society were all going to destruction in consequence of the so-called liberality of the age. Gentlemen, she thought, certainly did do things which gentlemen would not have done forty years ago; and as for ladies,—they, doubtless, were changed altogether. Most assuredly she could not have brought an Andy Gowran to her mother to tell such tales in their joint presence as this man had told!

Mrs. Hittaway had ridiculed her for saying that poor Lucy would die when forced to give up her lover. Mrs. Hittaway had spoken of the necessity of breaking up that engagement without a word of anger against Frank Greystock. According to Mrs. Hittaway's views Frank Greystock had amused himself in the most natural way in the world when he asked Lucy to be his wife. A governess like Lucy had been quite foolish to expect that such a man as Greystock was in earnest. Of course she must give up her lover; and if there must be blame, she must blame herself for her folly! Nevertheless, Lady Fawn was so soft-hearted that she believed that the sorrow would crush Lucy, even if it did not kill her.

But not the less was it her duty to tell Lucy what she thought to be the truth. The story of what had occurred among the rocks at Portray was very disagreeable, but she believed it to be true. The man had been making love to his cousin after his engagement to Lucy. And then, was it not quite manifest that he was neglecting poor Lucy in every way? He had not seen her for nearly six months. Had he intended to marry her, would he not have found a home for her at the deanery? Did he in any respect treat her as he would treat the girl whom he intended to marry? Putting all these things together, Lady Fawn thought that she saw that Lucy's case was hopeless;—and, so thinking, wrote to her the following letter:—


Fawn Court, 3rd March, 18––.

Dearest Lucy,
I have so much to say to you that I did think of getting Lady Linlithgow to let you come to us here for a day, but I believe it will perhaps be better that I should write. I think you leave Lady Linlithgow after the first week in April, and it is quite necessary that you should come to some fixed arrangement as to the future. If that were all, there need not be any trouble, as you will come here, of course. Indeed, this is your natural home, as we all feel; and I must say that we have missed you most terribly since you went,—not only for Cecilia and Nina, but for all of us. And I don't know that I should write at all if it wasn't for something else, that must be said sooner or later;—because, as to your coming here in April, that is so much a matter of course. The only mistake was, that you should ever have gone away. So we shall expect you here on whatever day you may arrange with Lady Linlithgow as to leaving her.


The poor, dear lady went on repeating her affectionate invitation, because of the difficulty she encountered in finding words with which to give the cruel counsel which she thought that it was her duty to offer.


And now, dearest Lucy, I must say what I believe to be the truth about Mr. Greystock. I think that you should teach yourself to forget him,—or, at any rate, that you should teach yourself to forget the offer which he made to you last autumn. Whether he was or was not in earnest then, I think that he has now determined to forget it. I fear there is no doubt that he has been making love to his cousin, Lady Eustace. You well know that I should not mention such a thing, if I had not the strongest possible grounds to convince me that I ought to do so. But, independent of this, his conduct to you during the last six months has been such as to make us all feel sure that the engagement is distasteful to him. He has probably found himself so placed that he cannot marry without money, and has wanted the firmness, or perhaps you will say the hardness of heart, to say so openly. I am sure of this, and so is Amelia, that it will be better for you to give the matter up altogether, and to come here and recover the blow among friends who will be as kind to you as possible. I know all that you will feel, and you have my fullest sympathy; but even such sorrows as that are cured by time, and by the mercy of God, which is not only infinite, but all-powerful.

Your most affectionate friend,

C. Fawn.


Lady Fawn, when she had written her letter, discussed it with Amelia, and the two together agreed that Lucy would never surmount the ill effects of the blow which was thus prophesied. ""As to saying it will kill her, mamma,"" said Amelia, ""I don't believe in that. If I were to break my leg, the accident might shorten my life, and this may shorten hers. It won't kill her in any other way. But it will alter her altogether. Nobody ever used to make herself happy so easily as Lucy Morris; but all that will be gone now.""

When Lucy received the letter, the immediate effect upon her, the effect which came from the first reading of it, was not very great. She succeeded for some half-hour in putting it aside, as referring to a subject on which she had quite made up her mind in a direction contrary to that indicated by her correspondent's advice. Lady Fawn told her that her lover intended to be false to her. She had thought the matter over very carefully within the last day or two, and had altogether made up her mind that she would continue to trust her lover. She had abstained from sending to him the letter which she had written, and had abstained on that resolution. Lady Fawn, of course, was as kind and friendly as a friend could be. She loved Lady Fawn dearly. But she was not bound to think Lady Fawn right, and in this instance she did not think Lady Fawn right. So she folded up the letter and put it in her pocket.

But by putting the letter into her pocket she could not put it out of her mind. Though she had resolved, of what use to her was a resolution in which she could not trust? Day had passed by after day, week after week, and month after month, and her very soul within her had become sad for want of seeing this man, who was living almost in the next street to her. She was ashamed to own to herself how many hours she had sat at the window, thinking that, perhaps, he might walk before the house in which he knew that she was immured. And, even had it been impossible that he should come to her, the post was open to him. She had scorned to write to him oftener than he would write to her, and now their correspondence had dwindled almost to nothing. He knew as well as did Lady Fawn when the period of her incarceration in Lady Linlithgow's dungeon would come to an end; and he knew, too, how great had been her hope that she might be accepted as a guest at the deanery when that period should arrive. He knew that she must look for a new home, unless he would tell her where she should live. Was it likely,—was it possible, that he should be silent so long if he still intended to make her his wife? No doubt he had come to remember his debts, to remember his ambition, to think of his cousin's wealth,—and to think also of his cousin's beauty. What right had she ever had to hope for such a position as that of his wife,—she who had neither money nor beauty,—she who had nothing to give him in return for his name and the shelter of his house beyond her mind and her heart? As she thought of it all, she looked down upon her faded grey frock, and stood up that she might glance at her features in the glass; and she saw how small she was and insignificant, and reminded herself that all she had in the world was a few pounds which she had saved and was still saving in order that she might go to him with decent clothes upon her back. Was it reasonable that she should expect it?

But why had he come to her and made her thus wretched? She could acknowledge to herself that she had been foolish, vain, utterly ignorant of her own value in venturing to hope; perhaps unmaidenly in allowing it to be seen that she had hoped;—but what was he in having first exalted her before all her friends, and then abasing her so terribly and bringing her to such utter shipwreck? From spoken or written reproaches she could, of course, abstain. She would neither write nor speak any;—but from unuttered reproaches how could she abstain? She had called him a traitor once in playful, loving irony, during those few hours in which her love had been to her a luxury that she could enjoy. But now he was a traitor indeed. Had he left her alone she would have loved him in silence, and not have been wretched in her love. She would, she knew, in that case, have had vigour enough and sufficient strength of character to bear her burthen without outward signs of suffering, without any inward suffering that would have disturbed the current of her life. But now everything was over with her. She had no thought of dying, but her future life was a blank to her.

She came down-stairs to sit at lunch with Lady Linlithgow, and the old woman did not perceive that anything was amiss with her companion. Further news had been heard of Lizzie Eustace, and of Lord Fawn, and of the robberies, and the countess declared how she had read in the newspaper that one man was already in custody for the burglary at the house in Hertford Street. From that subject she went on to tidings which had reached her from her old friend Lady Clantantram that the Fawn marriage was on again. ""Not that I believe it, my dear; because I think that Mr. Greystock has made it quite safe in that quarter."" All this Lucy heard, and never showed by a single sign, or by a motion of a muscle, that she was in pain. Then Lady Linlithgow asked her what she meant to do after the 5th of April. ""I don't see at all why you shouldn't stay here, if you like it, Miss Morris;—that is, if you have abandoned the stupid idea of an engagement with Frank Greystock."" Lucy smiled, and even thanked the countess, and said that she had made up her mind to go back to Richmond for a month or two, till she could get another engagement as a governess. Then she returned to her room and sat again at her window, looking out upon the street.

What did it matter now where she went? And yet she must go somewhere, and do something. There remained to her the wearisome possession of herself, and while she lived she must eat, and have clothes, and require shelter. She could not dawdle out a bitter existence under Lady Fawn's roof, eating the bread of charity, hanging about the rooms and shrubberies useless and idle. How bitter to her was that possession of herself, as she felt that there was nothing good to be done with the thing so possessed! She doubted even whether ever again she could become serviceable as a governess, and whether the energy would be left to her of earning her bread by teaching adequately the few things that she knew. But she must make the attempt,—and must go on making it, till God in his mercy should take her to himself.

And yet but a few months since life had been so sweet to her! As she felt this she was not thinking of those short days of excited, feverish bliss in which she had believed that all the good things of the world were to be showered into her lap; but of previous years in which everything had been with her as it was now,—with the one exception that she had not then been deceived. She had been full of smiles, and humour, and mirth, absolutely happy among her friends, though conscious of the necessity of earning her bread by the exercise of a most precarious profession,—while elated by no hope. Though she had loved the man and had been hopeless, she was happy. But now, surely, of all maidens and of all women, she was the most forlorn.
Having once acceded to the truth of Lady Fawn's views, she abandoned all hope. Everybody said so, and it was so. There was no word from any side to encourage her. The thing was done and over, and she would never mention his name again. She would simply beg of all the Fawns that no allusion might be made to him in her presence. She would never blame him, and certainly she would never praise him. As far as she could rule her tongue, she would never have his name upon her lips again.

She thought for a time that she would send the letter which she had already written. Any other letter she could not bring herself to write. Even to think of him was an agony to her; but to communicate her thoughts to him was worse than agony. It would be almost madness. What need was there for any letter? If the thing was done, it was done. Perhaps there remained with her,—staying by her without her own knowledge, some faint spark of hope, that even yet he might return to her. At last she resolved that there should be no letter, and she destroyed that which she had written.

But she did write a note to Lady Fawn, in which she gratefully accepted her old friend's kindness till such time as she could ""find a place."" ""As to that other subject,"" she said, ""I know that you are right. Please let it all be as though it had never been.""",7760528,en,en,en,between her son and her married daughter and lucy morris poor lady fawns life had become a burthen to her everything was astray and there was no happiness or tranquillity at fawn court of all simply human creeds the strongest existing creed for the present in the minds of the fawn ladies was that which had reference to the general iniquity of lizzie eustace she had been the cause of all these sorrows and she was hated so much the more because she had not been proved to be iniquitous before all the world there had been a time when it seemed to be admitted that she was so wicked in keeping the diamonds in opposition to the continued demands made for them by mr camperdown that all people would be justified in dropping her and lord fawn among the number but since the two robberies public opinion had veered round three or four points in lizzies favour and people were beginning to say that she had been illused then had come mrs hittaways evidence as to lizzies wicked doings down in scotlandthe wicked doings which andy gowran had described with a vehemence so terribly moral and that which had been at first as it were added to the diamonds as a supplementary weight thrown into the scale so that lizzies iniquities might bring her absolutely to the ground had gradually assumed the position of being the first charge against her lady fawn had felt no aversion to discussing the diamonds when lizzie was called a thief and a robber and a swindler by one or another of the ladies of the familywho in using those strong terms whispered the words as ladies are wont to do when they desire to lessen the impropriety of the strength of their language by the gentleness of the tone in which the words are spokenwhen lizzie was thus described in lady fawns hearing in her own house she had felt no repugnance to it it was well that the fact should be known so that everybody might be aware that her son was doing right in refusing to marry so wicked a lady but when the other thing was added to it when the story was told of what mr gowran had seen among the rocks and when gradually that became the special crime which was to justify her son in dropping the ladys acquaintance then lady fawn became very unhappy and found the subject to be as mrs hittaway had described it very distasteful and this trouble hit lucy morris as hard as it did lord fawn if lizzie eustace was unfit to marry lord fawn because of these things then was frank greystock not only unfit to marry lucy but most unlikely to do so whether fit or unfit for a week or two lady fawn had allowed herself to share lucys joy and to believe that mr greystock would prove himself true to the girl whose heart he had made all his ownbut she had soon learned to distrust the young member of parliament who was always behaving insolently to her son who spent his holidays down with lizzie eustace who never visited and rarely wrote to the girl he had promised to marry and as to whom all the world agreed in saying that he was far too much in debt to marry any woman who had not means to help him it was all sorrow and vexation together and yet when her married daughter would press the subject upon her and demand her cooperation she had no power of escaping mamma mrs hittaway had said lady glencora palliser has been with her and everybody is taking her up and if her conduct down in scotland isnt proved frederic will be made to marry her but what can i do my dear lady fawn had asked almost in tears insist that frederic shall know the whole truth replied mrs hittaway with energy of course it is very disagreeable nobody can feel it more than i do it is horrible to have to talk about such thingsand to think of them indeed it is claravery horrible but anything mamma is better than that frederic should be allowed to marry such a woman as that it must be proved to himhow unfit she is to be his wife with the view of carrying out this intention mrs hittaway had as we have seen received andy gowran at her own house and with the same view she took andy gowran the following morning down to richmond mrs hittaway and her mother and andy were closeted together for half an hour and lady fawn suffered grievously lord fawn had found that he couldnt hear the story and he had not heard it he had been strong enough to escape and had upon the whole got the best of it in the slight skirmish which had taken place between him and the scotchman but poor old lady fawn could not escape andy was allowed to be eloquent and the whole story was told to her though she would almost sooner have been flogged at a carts tail than have heard it then rafrashments were administered to andy of a nature which made him prefer fawn court to warwick square and he was told that he might go back to portray as soon as he pleased when he was gone mrs hittaway opened her mind to her mother altogether the truth is mamma that frederic will marry her but why i thought that he had declared that he would give it up i thought that he had said so to herself what of that if he retracts what he said he is so weak lady glencora palliser has made him promise to go and see her and he is to go today he is there now probablyat this very moment if he had been firm the thing was done after all that has taken place nobody would ever have supposed that his engagement need go for anything but what can he say to her now that he is with her except just do the mischief all over again i call it quite wicked in that womans interfering i do indeed shes a nasty insolent impertinent creaturethats what she is after all the trouble ive taken she comes and undoes it all with one word what can we do clara welli do believe that if frederic could be made to act as he ought to do just for a while she would marry her cousin mr greystock and then there would be an end of it altogether i really think that she likes him best and from all that i can hear she would take him now if frederic would only keep out of the way as for him of course he is doing his very best to get her he has not one shilling to rub against another and is over head and ears in debt poor lucy ejaculated lady fawn wellyes but really that is a matter of course i always thought mamma that you and amelia were a little wrong to coax her up in that belief but my dear the man proposed for her in the plainest possible manner i saw his letter no doubtmen do propose we all know that im sure i dont know what they get by it but i suppose it amuses them there used to be a sort of feeling that if a man behaved badly something would be done to him but thats all over now a man may propose to whom he likes and if he chooses to say afterwards that it doesnt mean anything theres nothing in the world to bring him to book thats very hard said the elder lady of whom everybody said that she did not understand the world as well as her daughter the girlsthey all know that it is so and i suppose it comes to the same thing in the long run the men have to marry and what one girl loses another girl gets it will kill lucy girls aint killed so easy mammanot nowadays saying that it will kill her wont change the mans nature it wasnt to be expected that such a man as frank greystock in debt and in parliament and going to all the best houses should marry your governess what was he to get by it thats what i want to know i suppose he loved her laws mamma how antediluvian you are no doubt he did like herafter his fashion though what he saw in her i never could tell i think miss morris would make a very nice wife for a country clergyman who didnt care how poor things were but she has no styleand as far as i can see she has no beauty why should such a man as frank greystock tie himself by the leg for ever to such a girl as that but mamma he doesnt mean to marry lucy morris would he have been going on in that way with his cousin down in scotland had he meant it he means nothing of the kind he means to marry lady eustaces income if he can get itand she would marry him before the summer if only we could keep frederic away from her mrs hittaway demanded from her mother

had been with her as it was nowwith the one exception that she had not then been deceived she had been full of smiles and humour and mirth absolutely happy among her friends though conscious of the necessity of earning her bread by the exercise of a most precarious professionwhile elated by no hope though she had loved the man and had been hopeless she was happy but now surely of all maidens and of all women she was the most forlorn having once acceded to the truth of lady fawns views she abandoned all hope everybody said so and it was so there was no word from any side to encourage her the thing was done and over and she would never mention his name again she would simply beg of all the fawns that no allusion might be made to him in her presence she would never blame him and certainly she would never praise him as far as she could rule her tongue she would never have his name upon her lips again she thought for a time that she would send the letter which she had already written any other letter she could not bring herself to write even to think of him was an agony to her but to communicate her thoughts to him was worse than agony it would be almost madness what need was there for any letter if the thing was done it was done perhaps there remained with herstaying by her without her own knowledge some faint spark of hope that even yet he might return to her at last she resolved that there should be no letter and she destroyed that which she had written but she did write a note to lady fawn in which she gratefully accepted her old friends kindness till such time as

The Villain,rap,RBN,2018,40,"{Luey,""Ferno Blaze""}","[Verse 1 - Ferno Blaze]
Forgive me for playing a villain to all of your church feelings
And all of your Sunday dealings and all of your misgivings
Of how my life should be living for that I say im sorry
But no apologies given I'm ridding myself of demons
That’s rumbling up in my closet disturbing my inner peace
Fighting these heavy battles and no one knows it but me
Been thrown under the bus and these tires running on me
And it seems I'm perceived  to be already damned
Don’t pride myself in flesh natural eyes can't understand
But he resides in me so through he I overstand
The world is unjust these peeps you can't trust
Close friends they turn coat best friends they turn foes
Less friends they just go, where to I don’t know
Got up on horse back and rode off without a word
So I mount hope on hope cos’ we walk a tight rope
This life a slippery slope and I hope we all cope
When the tides rose above us it seems we lost hope
And the waves came crashing down and I held on to hope
The ground was shaking under they came a great number
Was me and my only brother we wasn’t scared of nothing
Shed a teart for my pops when he passed away
And if you see him before I do please send him my love
I can't stand the separation but I know you with God
I close my eyes and see you smiling from the heavens above
Ferno was marked a villain like Vader was my profession
You thinking im Lex the Luther you silly you must be joker
Luey was marked a villain like Vader was his profession
You thinking he Lex the Luther you silly you must be joker
Thoroughbred from the eighties, liberated from hades
Haters be barking out like they caught a case of that rabies
My father his name was joseph he told a dream to his brothers
That story already written go check it out in the bible
Theres a goblin for every spider, bane for every bat
Striker for every Wolf, Magneto - Professor X
Darkenrhal for every seeker, the shredder for ninja turtles
Abacha for Gideon Orkar, Osama the twin towers
Fear not the world is ours our power is beyond powers
I'm powered by that power that beams from a strong tower
Braveheart like willy Wallace courageous we’re not cowards
Like salt we bring taste to a worlds that’s gone sour
[Verse 2 - Luey]
Forgive me for playing the villain to all of your Sunday feelings
And all of your churchy feelings I'm spitting my churchest feelings
Deep pain revealing too deep for penicillin
It seems that you don't listen If it ain't sex or women
Money cars or chilling and baby I can't help the feeling
Your tight dress revealing that deep down you feeling
A need for love that's appealing to my desire for peeling
You outta them clothes and have you curling your toes
But what is it all for? Them feelings we fall for
And there's nothing to show for all that pleasure we chase for
Forgive me for playing the villain Ain't tripping just in my feelings
I don't wanna be the hero Sometimes wanna be the killa
Don't wanna change the game or save it, Just get the skrilla
Don't wanna leave a legacy just do it for the figures
Don't wanna rap about jesus just rap about who Iller
Sometimes I wanna be all alone Nobody calling my phone
Just me myself in my zone, me myself in my zone
Me myself in my zone me myself in my zone
Just me i-self in my zone
I don't wanna be your brother Cos' when I'm down you kick me
With no plan to uplift me you hit me so why bother
Borderline on the edge of Everest with a sledge
No parachutes what's ahead just trusting in what he said
He'll never leave or forsake me Never leave or forsake me
Weaknesses overtake me Excesses try to break me
Evil days try to shake me, slipping and then he'll wake me
Cos' sometimes, sometimes
I don't wanna be the role model
I'd rather drown myself in a bottle
Or drown myself in the cuddle of a million shoulda been models
On the fast lane full throttle middle finger for all you
Doubters who feel I'm spoiled smoking weed like a royal
Everyday on my worst behavior, Everyday I'll need a savior
To save me from my behaviors and all of the bitter flavors
Of the sugar coated venomous that you quote
As praise while you devoted
To my demise like totems of Satan for post mortems
Of my career and my business
By telling me I'm offensive for playing offense relentless
I'm done overrating all the friendships
Of brotherhoods relentless shooting me down at any given instance so please keep your distance I'm violent with resistance
Can't you tell from this stance I taken with a wounded heart
Verbal assault really hit me hard
But I stand like mount Zion
In the shadow of Judah's lion
So forgive me for playing the villain
To all of your Sunday feelings and all your churchy feelings
Just spitting my churchest feelings
Just spitting my churchest feelings
From the heart

When the Bottom Drops Out,pop,Anfernee Harries,2020,84,{},"[Verse 1]
I still think about that little boy who watched
You fall to the ground whilst you’re praying to God
And all that I wanted was to take the pain away from your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
You’ve worked so hard to get to where you are
You sacrificed so much
After a worthless man left you all alone in the dark
No signs of light or a soft place to land

[Chorus]
Our memories in this house will never fade away
That butterfly on your back means so much to me
And when the bottom drops out all I’ll hear is your voice telling me that I’ll be

[Verse 2]
The love that I’ve always known
Lives and resides in the warmth of your embrace
And it’ll always stay that way
My stubborn ways are behind me now
[Pre-Chorus]
People come and people go
But some remain to change our lives for good
And offer us a soft and safe place to land

[Chorus]
Our memories in this house will never fade away
That butterfly on your back means so much to me
Because when the bottom drops out all I’ll hear is your voice telling me

[Bridge]
We all have dreams inside our hearts
That will never see the light of day
But don’t lose hope because I promise you
Life will turn around, if you just wait

[Chorus]
Our memories in this house will never fade away
That butterfly on your back means so much to me
Because when the bottom drops out all I’ll hear is your voice telling me
I’ll be okay

Our memories in this house will never fade away

Saturday Night Fish Fry,pop,Asleep at the Wheel,2006,80,{},"Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans
Then you can understand just what I mean
All through the week, it's quiet as a mouse
But on Saturday night, they go from house to house

You don't have to pay the usual admission
If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician
So if you happen to be just passin' by
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

Now my buddy and me was on the main stem
Foolin' around just me and him
We decided we could use a little something to eat
So we went to a house on Rampart Street
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease
And a lush little miss said, ""Come in, please""
And before we could even bat an eye
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

Now the folks was havin' the time of their life
And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife
Over in the corner was a beat up grand
Being played by a big fat piano man

Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
Some of them had on bobbie socks
But everybody was nice and high
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'
The bottles was flyin' and the fish was smellin'
And way up above all the noise they made
Somebody hollered, ""Better get out of here, this is a raid""

Now I didn't know we was breakin' the law
But somebody reached up and hit me on the jaw
They had us blocked off from the front to the back
And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potato sacks

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

I knew I could get away if I had a chance
But I was shakin' like I had the St. Vitus dance
Now I tried to crawl under a bathtub
When the policeman said, ""Where you goin' there, bub?""

Now they got us out of there like a house afire
Put us all in that Black Maria
Now, they might have missed a pitiful few
But they got poor me and my buddy too
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

We headed for jail in a dazed condition
They booked each one of us on suspicion
Now my chick came down and went for my bail
And finally got me out of that rotten jail

Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
Just mention a Saturday night fish fry
I don't care how many fish in the sea
But don't ever mention a fish to me

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

Goodbye, my eyes shed heavy tears
One for every soul still sitting on the fence between pain and arrogance

The boys on the train, the almighty tongue with prose spilled in vain

The sweetest of deceits in disguise

Break me, hate me and pierce me to the bone
Tame me, use me, please me, tease me

And I'm rushing once again

Ride Or Die,rap,Gavis Dean,2016,244,{},"Verse 1 (Gavis Dean)

Starving for greatness, I'm all on my grind
Caught in the future I'm ahead of my prime
Awaiting my shine, all on the line
Ain't fake it to make it, no livin' a lie
Said it and meant it I fuck up a check
Steady we ready might fuck up your neck
Saying we get it, cause I'm all up next
Praying they hate it, but all of us blessed
96 a old soul
Grindin' for the gold doe
Call my plug on the lolo
40 for the coco
Studying the word and all of the signs
Higher vibration thru my 3rd eye
Connected source and my forces align
Seeing your soul ain't got the sauce like mine

Bridge (Gavis Dean)
Popped another Xan
Things you cannot understand
Shawty tell me I'm the man
Molly and the water, yes I am
Livin' life so trill
Getting faded for the thrill
And I kill
Everything in my way
To get me my first mill

Hook (Gavis Dean)

Ride or Die, Ride or Die
Ridin' thru the night
On my grind
All the time
All them hours that I sacrificed
Ride or Die, Ride or Die
Headed to the top
Won't stop
Lust for foreign cars to cop
Told my mama we gon' pop

Verse 2

All on the low, grindin' for gold
Know that it's cold, wanting to blow
Spending the dough, but getting so old
Young enough to get it hoe
Roar of a lion, might start a riot
Talking that talk all about cyos
People say I ain't right boy
But bitch I been a wild boy
Wild boy
Wild boy
Wildin' on the low
Chasing that dough
Money over hoes

Fuck a bitch if she right
Getting faded if I like
I be riding tru the night
Don’t tell me what to do tonight

Fuck up the commas for all of my brothers
I'm dancing with satan all for my moma
Was stuck in the days that we went thru the trouble
Roaches and rats man we lived thru the struggle
Still stuck in the city and things still ain't changed
Trapped in my consciousness, I'm trapped in a cage
The mission to love with the anger to  rage
I told it before, I ain't been the same

Life Of Marcus Cato,misc,Plutarch,2014,20,{},"Marcus cato, we are told, was born at Tusculum, though (till he betook himself to civil and military affairs) he lived and was bred up in the country of the Sabines, where his father's estate lay. His ancestors seeming almost entirely unknown, he himself praises his father Marcus, as a worthy man and a brave soldier, and Cato, his great-grandfather, too, as one who had often obtained military prizes, and who, having lost five horses under him, received, on the account of his valour, the worth of them out of the public exchequer. Now it being the custom among the Romans to call those who, having no repute by birth, made themselves eminent by their own exertions, new men or upstarts, they called even Cato himself so, and so he confessed himself to be as to any public distinction or employment, but yet asserted that in the exploits and virtues of his ancestors he was very ancient. His third name originally was not Cato, but Priscus, though afterwards he had the surname of Cato, by reason of his abilities; for the Romans call a skilful or experienced man Catus. He was of a ruddy complexion and grey-eyed; as the writer, who, with no good-will, made the following epigram upon him lets us see:-

""Porcius, who snarls at all in every place,
With his grey eyes, and with his fiery face,
Even after death will scarce admitted be
Into the infernal realms by Hecate.""

He gained, in early life, a good habit of body by working with his own hands, and living temperately, and serving in war; and seemed to have an equal proportion both of health and strength. And he exerted and practised his eloquence through all the neighbourhood and little villages; thinking it as requisite as a second body, and an all but necessary organ to one who looks forward to something above a mere humble and inactive life. He would never refuse to be counsel for those who needed him, and was, indeed, early reckoned a good lawyer, and, ere long, a capable orator.

Hence his solidity and depth of character showed itself gradually more and more to those with whom he was concerned, and claimed, as it were, employment in great affairs and places of public command. Nor did he merely abstain from taking fees for his counsel and pleading, but did not even seem to put any high price on the honour which proceeded from such kind of combats, seeming much more desirous to signalize himself in the camp and in real fights; and while yet but a youth, had his breast covered with scars he had received from the enemy: being (as he himself says) but seventeen years old when he made his first campaign; in the time when Hannibal, in the height of his success, was burning and pillaging all Italy. In engagements he would strike boldly, without flinching, stand firm to his ground, fix a bold countenance upon his enemies, and with a harsh threatening voice accost them, justly thinking himself and telling others that such a rugged kind of behaviour sometimes terrifies the enemy more than the sword itself, In his marches he bore his own arms on foot, whilst one servant only followed, to carry the provision for his table, with whom he is said never to have been angry or hasty whilst he made ready his dinner or supper, but would, for the most part, when he was free from military duty, assist and help him himself to dress it. When he was with the army, he used to drink only water; unless, perhaps, when extremely thirsty, he might mingle it with a little vinegar, or if he found his strength fail him, take a little wine.

The little country house of Manius Curius, who had been thrice carried in triumph, happened to be near his farm; so that often going thither, and contemplating the small compass of the place, and plainness of the dwelling, he formed an idea of the mind of the person, who being one of the greatest of the Romans, and having subdued the most warlike nations, nay, had driven Pyrrhus out of Italy, now, after three triumphs, was contented to dig in so small a piece of ground, and live in such a cottage. Here it was that the ambassadors of the Samnites, finding him boiling turnips in the chimney corner, offered him a present of gold; but he sent them away with this saying; that he, who was content with such a supper, had no need of gold; and that he thought it more honourable to conquer those who possessed the gold, than to possess the gold itself. Cato, after reflecting upon these things, used to return and, reviewing his own farm, his servants, and housekeeping, increase his labour and retrench all superfluous expenses.

When Fabius Maximus took Tarentum, Cato, being then but a youth, was a soldier under him; and being lodged with one Nearchus, a Pythagorean, desired to understand some of his doctrine, and hearing from him the language, which Plato also uses- that pleasure is evil's chief bait; the body the principal calamity of the soul; and that those thoughts which most separate and take it off from the affections of the body most enfranchise and purify it; he fell in love the more with frugality and temperance. With this exception, he is said not to have studied Greek until when he was pretty old; and in rhetoric to have then profited a little by Thucydides, but more by Demosthenes; his writings, however, are considerably embellished with Greek sayings and stories; nay, many of these, translated word for word, are placed with his own opophthegms and sentences.

There was a man of the highest rank, and very influential among the Romans, called Valerius Flaccus, who was singularly skilful in discerning excellence yet in the bud, and also much disposed to nourish and advance it. He, it seems, had lands bordering upon Cato's; nor could he but admire when he understood from his servants the manner of his living, how he laboured with his own hands, went on foot betimes in the morning to the courts to assist those who wanted his counsel: how, returning home again, when it was winter, he would throw a loose frock over his shoulders, and in the summer time would work without anything on among his domestics, sit down with them, eat of the same bread, and drink of the same wine. When they spoke, also, of other good qualities, his fair dealing and moderation, mentioning also some of his wise sayings, he ordered that he should be invited to supper; and thus becoming personally assured of his fine temper and his superior character, which, like a plant, seemed only to require culture and a better situation, he urged and persuaded him to apply himself to state affairs at Rome. Thither, therefore, he went, and by his pleading soon gained many friends and admirers; but, Valerius chiefly assisting his promotion, he first of all got appointed tribune in the army, and afterwards was made quaestor, or treasurer. And now becoming eminent and noted, he passed, with Valerius himself, through the greatest commands, being first his colleague as consul, and then censor. But among all the ancient senators, he most attached himself to Fabius Maximus; not so much for the honour of his person, and the greatness of his power, as that he might have before him his habit and manner of life, as the best examples to follow; and so he did not hesitate to oppose Scipio the Great, who, being then but a young man, seemed to set himself against the power of Fabius, and to be envied by him. For being sent together with him as treasurer, when he saw him, according to his natural custom, make great expenses, and distribute among the soldiers without sparing, he freely told him that the expense in itself was not the greatest thing to be considered, but that he was corrupting the frugality of the soldiers, by giving them the means to abandon themselves to unnecessary pleasures and luxuries. Scipio answered, that he had no need for so accurate a treasurer (bearing on as he was, so to say, full sail to the war), and that he owed the people an account of his actions, and not of the money he spent. Hereupon Cato returned from Sicily and, together with Fabius, made loud complaints in the open senate of Scipio's lavishing unspeakable sums, and childishly loitering away his time in wrestling matches and comedies, as if he were not to make war, but holiday; and thus succeeded in getting some of the tribunes of the people sent to call him back to Rome, in case the accusations should prove true. But Scipio demonstrating, as it were, to them, by his preparations, the coming victory, and, being found merely to be living pleasantly with his friends, when there was nothing else to do, but in no respect because of that easiness and liberality at all the more negligent in things of consequence and moment, without impediment, set sail toward the war.

Cato grew more and more powerful by his eloquence, so that he was commonly called the Roman Demosthenes; but his manner of life was yet more famous and talked of. For oratorical skill was, as an accomplishment, commonly studied and sought after by all young men; but he was very rare who would cultivate the old habits of bodily labour, or prefer a light supper, and a breakfast which never saw the fire, or be in love with poor clothes and a homely lodging, or could set his ambition rather on doing without luxuries than on possessing them. For now the state, unable to keep its purity by reason of its greatness, and having so many affairs, and people from all parts under its government, was fain to admit many mixed customers and new examples of living. With reason, therefore, everybody admired Cato, when they saw others sink under labours and grow effeminate by pleasures; and yet beheld him unconquered by either, and that not only when he was young and desirous of honour, but also when old and grey-headed, after a consulship and triumph; like some famous victor in the games, persevering in his exercise and maintaining his character to the very last. He himself says that he never wore a suit of clothes which cost more than a hundred drachmas; and that, when he was general and consul, he drank the same wine which his workmen did; and that the meat or fish which was bought in the meat-market for his dinner did not cost above thirty asses. All which was for the sake of the commonwealth, that so his body might be the hardier for the war. Having a piece of embroidered Babylonian tapestry left him, he sold it; because none of his farmhouses were so much as plastered. Nor did he ever buy a slave for above fifteen hundred drachmas; as he did not seek for effeminate and handsome ones, but able sturdy workmen, horse-keepers and cow-herds: and these he thought ought to be sold again, when they grew old, and no useless servants fed in the house. In short, he reckoned nothing a good bargain which was superfluous; but whatever it was, though sold for a farthing, he would think it a great price, if you had no need of it; and was for the purchase of lands for sowing and feeding, rather than grounds for sweeping and watering.

Some imputed these things to petty avarice, but others approved of him, as if he had only the more strictly denied himself for the rectifying and amending of others. Yet certainly, in my judgment, it marks an over-rigid temper for a man to take the work out of his servants as out of brute beasts, turning them off and selling them in their old age, and thinking there ought to be no further commerce between man and man than whilst there arises some profit by it. We see that kindness or humanity has a larger field than bare justice to exercise itself in; law and justice we cannot, in the nature of things, employ on others than men; but we may extend our goodness and charity even to irrational creatures; and such acts flow from a gentle nature, as water from an abundant spring. It is doubtless the part of a kind-natured man to keep even worn-out horses and dogs, and not only take care of them when they are foals and whelps, but also when they are grown old. The Athenians, when they built their Hecatompedon, turned those mules loose to feed freely which they had observed to have done the hardest labour. One of these (they say) came once of itself to offer its service, and ran along with, nay, and went before, the teams which drew the wagons up to the acropolis, as if it would incite and encourage them to draw more stoutly; upon which there passed a vote that the creature should be kept at the public charge even till it died. The graves of Cimon's horses, which thrice won the Olympian races, are yet to be seen close by his own monument. Old Xanthippus, too (amongst many others who buried the dogs they had bred up), entombed his which swam after his galley to Salamis, when the people fled from Athens, on the top of a cliff, which they call the Dog's Tomb to this day. Nor are we to use living creatures like old shoes or dishes and throw them away when they are worn out or broken with service; but if it were for nothing else, but by way of study and practice in humanity, a man ought always to prehabituate himself in these things to be of a kind and sweet disposition. As to myself, I would not so much as sell my draught ox on the account of his age, much less for a small piece of money sell a poor old man, and so chase him, as it were, from his own country, by turning him not only out of the place where he has lived a long while, but also out of the manner of living he has been accustomed to, and that more especially when he would be as useless to the buyer as to the seller. Yet Cato for all this glories that he left that very horse in Spain which he used in the wars when he was consul, only because he would not put the public to the charge of his freight. Whether these acts are to be ascribed to the greatness or pettiness of his spirit, let every one argue as they please.
For his general temperance, however, and self-control he really deserves the highest admiration. For when he commanded the army, he never took for himself, and those that belonged to him, above three bushels of wheat for a month, and somewhat less than a bushel and a half a day of barley for his baggage-cattle. And when he entered upon the government of Sardinia, where his predecessors had been used to require tents, bedding and clothes upon the public account, and to charge the state heavily with the cost of provisions and entertainments for a great train of servants and friends, the difference he showed in his economy was something incredible. There was nothing of any sort for which he put the public to expense; he would walk without a carriage to visit the cities, with one only of the common town officers, who carried his dress, and a cup to offer libation with. Yet though he seemed thus easy and sparing to all who were under his power, he, on the other hand, showed most inflexible severity and strictness in what related to public justice, and was rigorous and precise in what concerned the ordinances of the commonwealth; so that the Roman government never seemed more terrible, nor yet more mild than under his administration.

His very manner of speaking seemed to have such a kind of idea with it; for it was courteous, and yet forcible; pleasant, yet overwhelming; facetious, yet austere; sententious, and yet vehement; like Socrates, in the description of Plato, who seemed outwardly to those about him to be but a simple, talkative, blunt fellow; whilst at the bottom he was full of such gravity and matter, as would even move tears and touch the very hearts of his auditors. And, therefore, I know not what has persuaded some to say that Cato's style was chiefly like that of Lysias. However, let us leave those to judge of these things who profess most to distinguish between the several kinds of oratorical style in Latin; whilst we write down some of his memorable sayings; being of the opinion that a man's character appears much more by his words than, as some think it does, by his looks.

Being once desirous to dissuade the common people of Rome from their unseasonable and impetuous clamour for largesses and distributions of corn, he began thus to harangue them: ""It is a difficult task, O citizens, to make speeches to the belly, which has no ears."" Reproving, also, their sumptuous habits, he said it was hard to preserve a city where a fish sold for more than an ox. He had a saying, also, that the Roman people were like sheep; for they, when single, do not obey, but when altogether in a flock, they follow their leaders: ""So you,"" said he, ""when you have got together in a body, let yourselves be guided by those whom singly you would never think of being advised by."" Discoursing of the power of women: ""Men,"" said he, ""usually command women; but we command all men, and the women command us."" But this, indeed, is borrowed from the sayings of Themistocles, who, when his son was making many demands of him by means of the mother, said, ""O woman, the Athenians govern the Greeks; I govern the Athenians, but you govern me, and your son governs you; so let him use his power sparingly, since, simple as he is, he can do more than all the Greeks together."" Another saying of Cato's was, that the Roman people did not only fix the value of such and such purple dyes, but also of such and such habits of life: ""For,"" said he, ""as dyers most of all dye such colours as they see to be most agreeable, so the young men learn, and zealously affect, what is most popular with you."" He also exhorted them that, if they were grown great by their virtue and temperance, they should not change for the worse; but if intemperance and vice had made them great, they should change for the better; for by that means they were grown indeed quite great enough. He would say, likewise, of men who wanted to be continually in office, that apparently they did not know their road; since they could not do without beadles to guide them on it. He also reproved the citizens for choosing still the same men as their magistrates: ""For you will seem,"" said he, ""either not to esteem government worth much, or to think few worthy to hold it."" Speaking, too, of a certain enemy of his, who lived a very base and discreditable life: ""It is considered,"" he said, ""rather as a curse than a blessing on him, that this fellow's mother prays that she may leave him behind her."" Pointing at one who had sold the land which his father had left him, and which lay near the seaside, he pretended to express his wonder at his being stronger even than the sea itself; for what it washed away with a great deal of labour, he with a great deal of ease drank away. When the senate, with a great deal of splendour, received King Eumenes on his visit to Rome, and the chief citizens strove who should be most about him, Cato appeared to regard him with suspicion and apprehension; and when one that stood by, too, took occasion to say that he was a very good prince and a great lover of the Romans: ""It may be so,"" said Cato; ""but by nature this same animal of a king is a kind of man-eater;"" nor, indeed, were there ever kings who deserved to be compared with Epaminondas, Pericles, Themistocles, Manius Curius, or Hamilcar, surnamed Barcas. He used to say, too, that his enemies envied him because he had to get up every day before light and neglect his own business to follow that of the public. He would also tell you that he had rather be deprived of the reward for doing well than not to suffer the punishment for doing ill; and that he could pardon all offenders but himself.

The Romans having sent three ambassadors to Bithynia, of whom one was gouty, another had his skull trepanned, and the other seemed little better than a fool, Cato, laughing, gave out that the Romans had sent an embassy which had neither feet, head, nor heart. His interest being entreated by Scipio, on account of Polybius, for the Achaean exiles, and there happening to be a great discussion in the senate about it, some being for, and some against their return, Cato, standing up, thus delivered himself: ""Here do we sit all day long, as if we had nothing to do but beat our brains whether these old Greeks should be carried to their graves by the bearers here or by those in Achaea."" The senate voting their return, it seems that a few days after Polybius's friends further wished that it should be further moved in the senate that the said banished persons should receive again the honours which they first had in Achaea; and to this purpose they sounded Cato for his opinion; but he, smiling, answered, that Polybius, Ulysses like, having escaped out of the Cyclops' den, wanted, it would seem, to go back again because he had left his cap and belt behind him. He used to assert, also, that wise men profited more by fools, than fools by wise men for that wise men avoided the faults of fools, but that fools would not imitate the good examples of wise men. He would profess, too, that he was more taken with young men that blushed than with those who looked pale; and that he never desired to have a soldier that moved his hands too much in marching, and his feet too much in fighting; or snored louder than he shouted. Ridiculing a fat, overgrown man: ""What use,"" said he, ""can the state turn a man's body to, when all between the throat and groin is taken up by the belly?"" When one who was much given to pleasures desired his acquaintance, begging his pardon, he said he could not live with a man whose palate was of a quicker sense than his heart. He would likewise say that the soul of a lover lived in the body of another: and that in his whole life he most repented of three things; one was, that he had trusted a secret to a woman; another that he went by water when he might have gone by land; the third, that he had remained one whole day without doing any business of moment. Applying himself to an old man who was committing some vice: ""Friend,"" said he, ""old age has of itself blemishes enough; do not you add to it the deformity of vice."" Speaking to a tribune, who was reputed a Poisoner, and was very violent for the bringing in of a bill, in order to make a certain law: ""Young man,"" cried he, ""I know not which would be better, to drink, what you mix, or confirm what you would put up for a law."" Being reviled by a fellow who lived a profligate and wicked life: ""A contest,"" replied he, ""is unequal between you and me: for you can hear ill words easily, and can as easily give them: but it is unpleasant to me to give such, and unusual to hear them."" Such was his manner of expressing himself in his memorable sayings.

Being chosen consul, with his friend and familiar Valerius Flaccus, the government of that part of Spain which the Romans called the Hither Spain fell to his lot. Here, as he was engaged in reducing some of the tribes by force, and bringing over others by good words, a large army of barbarians fell upon him, so that there was danger of being disgracefully forced out again. He therefore called upon his neighbours, the Celtiberians, for help; and on their demanding two hundred talents for their assistance, everybody else thought it intolerable that even the Romans should promise barbarians a reward for their aid; but Cato said there was no discredit or harm in it; for, if they overcame, they would pay them out of the enemy's purse, and not out of their own; but if they were overcome, there would be nobody left either to demand the reward or to pay it. However, he won that battle completely, and, after that, all his other affairs succeeded splendidly. Polybius says that, by his command, the walls of all the cities on this side the river Baetis were in one day's time demolished, and yet there were a great many of them full of brave and warlike men. Cato himself says that he took more cities than he stayed days in Spain. Neither is this a mere rhodomontade, if it be true that the number was four hundred. And though the soldiers themselves had got much in the fights, yet he distributed a pound of silver to every man of them, saying, it was better that many of the Romans should return home with silver, rather than a few with gold. For himself, he affirms, that of all the things that were taken, nothing came to him beyond what he ate and drank. ""Neither do I find fault,"" continued he, ""with those that seek to profit by these spoils, but I had rather compete in valour with the best, than in wealth with the richest, or with the most covetous in love of money."" Nor did he merely keep himself clear from taking anything, but even all those who more immediately belonged to him. He had five servants with him in the army; one of whom called Paccus, bought three boys out of those who were taken captive; which Cato coming to understand, the man, rather than venture into his presence, hanged himself. Cato sold the boys, and carried the price he got for them into the public exchequer.

Scipio the Great, being his enemy, and desiring, whilst he was carrying all things so successfully, to obstruct him, and take the affairs of Spain into his own hands, succeeded in getting himself appointed his successor in the government, and, making all possible haste, put a term to Cato's authority. But he, taking with him a convoy of five cohorts of foot and five hundred horse to attend him home, overthrew by the way the Lacetanians, and taking from them six hundred deserters, caused them all to be beheaded; upon which Scipio seemed to be in indignation, but Cato, in mock disparagement of himself, said, ""Rome would become great indeed, if the most honourable and great men would not yield up the first place of valour to those who were more obscure, and when they who were of the commonalty (as he himself was) would contend in valour with those who were most eminent in birth and honour."" The senate having voted to change nothing of what had been established by Cato, the government passed away under Scipio to no manner of purpose, in idleness and doing nothing; and so diminished his credit much more than Cato's. Nor did Cato, who now received a triumph, remit after this and slacken the reins of virtue, as many do, who strive not so much for virtue's sake, as for vainglory, and having attained the highest honours, as the consulship and triumphs, pass the rest of their life in pleasure and idleness, and quit all public affairs. But he, like those who are just entered upon public life for the first time, and thirst after gaining honour and glory in some new office, strained himself, as if he were but just setting out; and offering still publicly his service to his friends and citizens, would give up neither his pleadings nor his soldiery.

He accompanied and assisted Tiberius Sempronius, as his lieutenant, when he went into Thrace and to the Danube; and, in the quality of tribune, went with Manius Acilius into Greece, against Antiochus the Great, who, after Hannibal, more than any one struck terror into the Romans. For having reduced once more under a single command almost the whole of Asia, all, namely, that Seleucus Nicator had possessed, and having brought into obedience many warlike nations of the barbarians, he longed to fall upon the Romans, as if they only were now worthy to fight with him. So across he came with his forces, pretending, as a specious cause of the war, that it was to free the Greeks, who had indeed no need of it, they having been but newly delivered from the power of king Philip and the Macedonians, and made independent, with the free use of their own laws, by the goodness of the Romans themselves: so that all Greece was in commotion and excitement, having been corrupted by the hopes of royal aid which the popular leaders in their cities put them into. Manius, therefore, sent ambassadors to the different cities; and Titus Flaminius (as is written in the account of him) suppressed and quieted most of the attempts of the innovators, without any trouble. Cato brought over the Corinthians, those of Patrae and Aegium, and spent a good deal of time at Athens. There is also an oration of his said to be extant which he spoke in Greek to the people; in which he expressed his admiration of the virtue of the ancient Athenians, and signified that he came with a great deal of pleasure to be a spectator of the beauty and greatness of their city. But this is a fiction; for he spoke to the Athenians by an interpreter, though he was able to have spoken himself; but he wished to observe the usage of his own country, and laughed at those who admired nothing but what was in Greek. Jesting upon Postumius Albinus, who had written an historical work in Greek, and requested that allowances might be made for his attempt, he said that allowance indeed might be made if he had done it under the express compulsion of an Amphictyonic decree. The Athenians, he says, admired the quickness and vehemence of his speech; for an interpreter would be very long in repeating what he expressed with a great deal of brevity; but on the whole he professed to believe that the words of the Greeks came only from their lips, whilst those of the Romans came from their hearts.

Now Antiochus, having occupied with his army the narrow passages about Thermopylae, and added palisades and walls to the natural fortifications of the place, sat down there, thinking he had done enough to divert the war; and the Romans, indeed, seemed wholly to despair of forcing the passage; but Cato, calling to mind the compass and circuit which the Persians had formerly made to come at this place, went forth in the night, taking along with him part of the army. Whilst they were climbing up, the guide, who was a prisoner, missed the way, and wandering up and down by impracticable and precipitous paths, filled the soldiers with fear and despondency. Cato, perceiving the danger, commanded all the rest to halt, and stay where they were, whilst he himself, taking along with him one Lucius Manlius, a most expert man at climbing mountains, went forward with a great deal of labour and danger, in the dark night, and without the least moonshine, among the wild olive-trees and steep craggy rocks, there being nothing but precipices and darkness before their eyes, till they struck into a little pass which they thought might lead down into the enemy's camp. There they put up marks upon some conspicuous peaks which surmount the hill called Callidromon, and, returning again, they led the army along with them to the said marks, till they got into their little path again, and there once made a halt; but when they began to go further, the path deserted them at a precipice, where they were in another strait and fear; nor did they perceive that they were all this while near the enemy. And now the day began to give some light, when they seemed to hear a noise, and presently after to see the Greek trenches and the guard at the foot of the rock. Here, therefore, Cato halted his forces, and commanded the troops from Firmum only, without the rest, to stick by him, as he had always found them faithful and ready. And when they came up and formed around him in close order, he thus spoke to them: ""I desire,"" he said, ""to take one of the enemy alive, that so I may understand what men these are who guard the passage; their number; and with what discipline, order, and preparation they expect us; but this feat,"" continued he, ""must be an act of a great deal of quickness and boldness, such as that of lions, when they dart upon some timorous animal."" Cato had no sooner thus expressed himself, but the Firmans forthwith rushed down the mountain, just as they were, upon the guard, and, falling unexpectedly upon them, affrighted and dispersed them all. One armed man they took, and brought to Cato, who quickly learned from him that the rest of the forces lay in the narrow passage about the king; that those who kept the tops of the rocks were six hundred choice Aetolians. Cato, therefore, despising the smallness of their number and carelessness, forthwith drawing his sword, fell upon them with a great noise of trumpets and shouting. The enemy, perceiving them thus tumbling, as it were, upon them from the precipices, flew to the main body, and put all things into disorder there.

In the meantime, whilst Manius was forcing the works below, and pouring the thickest of his forces into the narrow passages, Antiochus was hit in the mouth with a stone, so that his teeth being beaten out by it, he felt such excessive pain, that he was fain to turn away with his horse; nor did any part of his army stand the shock of the Romans. Yet, though there seemed no reasonable hope of flight, where all paths were so difficult, and where there were deep marshes and steep rocks, which looked as if they were ready to receive those who should stumble, the fugitives, nevertheless, crowding and pressing together in the narrow passages, destroyed even one another in their terror of the swords and blows of the enemy. Cato (as it plainly appears) was never oversparing of his own praises, and seldom shunned boasting of any exploit; which quality, indeed, he seems to have thought the natural accompaniment of great actions; and with these particular exploits he was highly puffed up; he says that those who saw him that day pursuing and slaying the enemies were ready to assert that Cato owed not so much to the public as the public did to Cato; nay, he adds, that Manius the consul, coming hot from the fight, embraced him for a great while, when both were all in a sweat; and then cried out with joy that neither he himself, no, nor all the people together, could make him a recompense equal to his actions. After the fight he was sent to Rome, that he himself might be the messenger of it: and so, with a favourable wind, he sailed to Brundusium, and in one day got from thence to Tarentum; and having travelled four days more, upon the fifth, counting from the time of his landing, he arrived at Rome, and so brought the first news of the victory himself; and filled the whole city with joy and sacrifices, and the people with the belief that they were able to conquer every sea and every land.

These are pretty nearly all the eminent actions of Cato relating to military affairs: in civil policy, he was of opinion that one chief duty consisted in accusing and indicting criminals. He himself prosecuted many, and he would also assist others who prosecuted them, nay, would even procure such, as he did the Petilii against Scipio; but not being able to destroy him, by reason of the nobleness of his family, and the real greatness of his mind, which enabled him to trample all calumnies under foot, Cato at last would meddle no more with him; yet joining with the accusers against Scipio's brother Lucius, he succeeded in obtaining a sentence against him, which condemned him to the payment of a large sum of money to the state; and being insolvent, and in danger of being thrown into jail, he was, by the interposition of the tribunes of the people, with much ado dismissed. It is also said of Cato, that when he met a certain youth, who had effected the disgrace of one of his father's enemies, walking in the market-place, he shook him by the hand, telling him, that this was what we ought to sacrifice to our dead parents- not lambs and goats, but the tears and condemnations of their adversaries. But neither did he himself escape with impunity in his management of affairs; for if he gave his enemies but the least hold, he was still in danger, and exposed to be brought to justice. He is reported to have escaped at least fifty indictments; and one above the rest, which was the last, when he was eighty-six years old, about which time he uttered the well-known saying, that it was hard for him who had lived with one generation of men, to plead now before another. Neither did he make this the least of his lawsuits; for, four years after, when he was fourscore and ten, he accused Servilius Galba: so that his life and actions extended, we may say, as Nestor's did, over three ordinary ages of man. For, having had many contests, as we have related, with Scipio the Great, about affairs of state, he continued them down to Scipio the younger, who was the adopted grandson of the former, and the son of that Paulus who overthrew Perseus and the Macedonians.

Ten years after his consulship, Cato stood for the office of censor, which was indeed the summit of all honour, and in a manner the highest step in civil affairs; for besides all other power, it had also that of an inquisition into every one's life and manners. For the Romans thought that no marriage, or rearing of children, nay, no feast or drinking-bout, ought to be permitted according to every one's appetite or fancy, without being examined and inquired into; being indeed of opinion that a man's character was much sooner perceived in things of this sort than in what is done publicly and in open day. They chose, therefore, two persons, one out of the patricians, the other out of the commons, who were to watch, correct, and punish, if any one ran too much into voluptuousness, or transgressed the usual manner of life of his country; and these they called Censors. They had power to take away a horse, or expel out of the senate any one who lived intemperately and out of order. It was also their business to take an estimate of what every one was worth, and to put down in registers everybody's birth and quality; besides many other prerogatives. And therefore the chief nobility opposed his pretensions to it. Jealousy prompted the patricians, who thought that it would be a stain to everybody's nobility, if men of no original honour should rise to the highest dignity and power; while others, conscious of their own evil practices, and of the violation of the laws and customs of their country, were afraid of the austerity of the man; which, in an office of such great power, was likely to prove most uncompromising and severe. And so, consulting among themselves, they brought forward seven candidates in opposition to him, who sedulously set themselves to court the people's favour by fair promises, as though what they wished for was indulgent and easy government. Cato, on the contrary, promising no such mildness, but plainly threatening evil livers, from the very hustings openly declared himself, and exclaiming that the city needed a great and thorough purgation, called upon the people, if they were wise, not to choose the gentlest, but the roughest of physicians; such a one, he said, he was, and Valerius Flaccus, one of the patricians, another; together with him, he doubted not but he should do something worth the while, and that by cutting to pieces and burning like a hydra all luxury and voluptuousness. He added, too, that he saw all the rest endeavouring after the office with ill intent, because they were afraid of those who would exercise it justly, as they ought. And so truly great and so worthy of great men to be its leaders was, it would seem the Roman people, that they did not fear the severity and grim countenance of Cato, but rejecting those smooth promisers who were ready to do all things to ingratiate themselves, they took him, together with Flaccus; obeying his recommendations not as though he were a candidate, but as if he had had the actual power of commanding and governing already.

Cato named, as chief of the senate, his friend and colleague Lucius Valerius Flaccus, and expelled, among many others, Lucius Quintius, who had been consul seven years before, and (which was greater honour to him than the consulship) brother to that Titus Flaminius who overthrew King Philip. The reason he had for his expulsion was this. Lucius, it seems, took along with him in all his commands a youth whom he had kept as his companion from the flower of his age, and to whom he gave as much power and respect as to the chiefest of his friends and relations.

Now it happened that Lucius being consular governor of one of the provinces, the youth setting himself down by him, as he used to do, among other flatteries with which he played upon him, when he was in his cups, told him he loved him so dearly that, ""though there was a show of gladiators to be seen at Rome, and I,"" he said, ""had never beheld one in my life; and though I, as it were, longed to see a man killed, yet I made all possible haste to come to you."" Upon this Lucius, returning his fondness, replied, ""Do not be melancholy on that account; I can remedy that."" Ordering therefore, forthwith, one of those condemned to die to be brought to the feast, together with the headsman and axe, he asked the youth if he wished to see him executed. The boy answering that he did, Lucius commanded the executioner to cut off his neck; and this several historians mention; and Cicero, indeed, in his dialogue de Senectute, introduces Cato relating it himself. But Livy says that he that was killed was a Gaulish deserter, and that Lucius did not execute him by the stroke of the executioner, but with his own hand; and that it is so stated in Cato's speech.
Lucius being thus expelled out of the senate by Cato, his brother took it very ill, and appealing to the people, desired that Cato should declare his reasons; and when he began to relate this transaction of the feast, Lucius endeavoured to deny it; but Cato challenging him to a formal investigation, he fell off and refused it, so that he was then acknowledged to suffer deservedly. Afterwards, however, when there was some show at the theatre, he passed by the seats where those who had been consuls used to be placed, and taking his seat a great way off, excited the compassion of the common people, who presently with a great noise made him go forward, and as much as they could tried to set right and salve over what had happened. Manilius, also, who, according to the public expectation, would have been next consul, he threw out of the senate, because, in the presence of his daughter, and in open day, he had kissed his wife. He said that, as for himself, his wife never came into his arms except when there was great thunder; so that it was for jest with him, that it was a pleasure for him, when Jupiter thundered.

His treatment of Lucius, likewise the brother of Scipio, and one who had been honoured with a triumph, occasioned some odium against Cato; for he took his horse from him, and was thought to do it with a design of putting an affront on Scipio Africanus, now dead. But he gave most general annoyance by retrenching people's luxury; for though (most of the youth being thereby already corrupted) it seemed almost impossible to take it away with an open hand and directly, yet going, as it were, obliquely around, he caused all dress, carriages, women's ornaments, household furniture, whose price exceeded one thousand five hundred drachmas, to be rated at ten times as much as they were worth; intending by thus making the assessments greater, to increase the taxes paid upon them. He also ordained that upon every thousand asses of property of this kind, three should be paid, so that people, burdened with these extra charges, and seeing others of as good estates, but more frugal and sparing, paying less into the public exchequer, might be tried out of their prodigality. And thus, on the one side, not only those were disgusted at Cato who bore the taxes for the sake of their luxury, but those, too, who on the other side laid by their luxury for fear of the taxes. For people in general reckon that an order not to display their riches is equivalent to the taking away of their riches, because riches are seen much more in superfluous than in necessary things. Indeed this was what excited the wonder of Ariston the philosopher; that we account those who possess superfluous things more happy than those who abound with what is necessary and useful. But when one of his friends asked Scopas, the rich Thessalian, to give him some article of no great utility, saying that it was not a thing that he had any great need or use for himself, ""In truth,"" replied he, ""it is just these useless and unnecessary things that make my wealth and happiness."" Thus the desire of riches does not proceed from a natural passion within us, but arises rather from vulgar out-of-doors opinion of other people.

Cato, notwithstanding, being little solicitous as to those who exclaimed against him, increased his austerity. He caused the pipes, through which some persons brought the public water into their houses and gardens, to be cut, and threw down all buildings which jutted out into the common streets. He beat down also the price in contracts for public works to the lowest, and raised it in contracts for farming the taxes to the highest sum; by which proceedings he drew a great deal of hatred upon himself. Those who were of Titus Flaminius's party cancelled in the senate all the bargains and contracts made by him for the repairing and carrying on of the sacred and public buildings as unadvantageous to the commonwealth. They incited also the boldest of the tribunes of the people to accuse him and to fine him two talents. They likewise much opposed him in building the court or basilica, which he caused to be erected at the common charge, just by the senate-house, in the market-place, and called by his own name, the Porcian. However, the people, it seems, liked his censorship wondrously well; for, setting up a statue for him in the temple of the goddess of Health, they put an inscription under it, not recording his commands in war or his triumph, but to the effect that this was Cato the Censor, who, by his good discipline and wise and temperate ordinances, reclaimed the Roman commonwealth when it was declining and sinking down into vice. Before this honour was done to himself, he used to laugh at those who loved such kind of things, saying, that they did not see that they were taking pride in the workmanship of brass-founders and painters; whereas the citizens bore about his best likeness in their breasts. And when any seemed to wonder that he should have never a statue, while many ordinary persons had one, ""I would,"" said he, ""much rather be asked, why I have not one, than why I have one."" In short, he would not have any honest citizen endure to be praised, except it might prove advantageous to the commonwealth. Yet still he had passed the highest commendation on himself; for he tells us that those who did anything wrong, and were found fault with, used to say it was not worth while to blame them, for they were not Catos. He also adds, that they who awkwardly mimicked some of his actions were called left-handed Catos; and that the senate in perilous times would cast their eyes on him, as upon a pilot in a ship, and that often when he was not present they put off affairs of greatest consequence. These things are indeed also testified of him by others; for he had a great authority in the city, alike for his life, his eloquence, and his age.

He was also a good father, an excellent husband to his wife, and an extraordinary economist; and as he did not manage his affairs of this kind carelessly, and as things of little moment, I think I ought to record a little further whatever was commendable in him in these points. He married a wife more noble than rich; being of opinion that the rich and the high-born are equally haughty and proud; but that those of noble blood would be more ashamed of base things, and consequently more obedient to their husbands in all that was fit and right. A man who beat his wife or child laid violent hands, he said, on what was most sacred; and a good husband he reckoned worthy of more praise than a great senator; and he admired the ancient Socrates for nothing so much as for having lived a temperate and contented life with a wife who was a scold, and children who were half-witted.

As soon as he had a son born, though he had never such urgent business upon his hands, unless it were some public matter, he would be by when his wife washed it and dressed it in its swaddling clothes. For she herself suckled it, nay, she often too gave her breast to her servants' children, to produce, by suckling the same milk, a kind of natural love in them to her son. When he began to come to years of discretion, Cato himself would teach him to read, although he had a servant, a very good grammarian, called Chilo, who taught many others; but he thought not fit, as he himself said, to have his son reprimanded by a slave, or pulled, it may be, by the ears when found tardy in his lesson: nor would he have him owe to a servant the obligation of so great a thing as his learning; he himself, therefore (as we were saying), taught him his grammar, law, and his gymnastic exercises. Nor did he only show him, too, how to throw a dart, to fight in armour, and to ride, but to box also and to endure both heat and cold, and to swim over the most rapid and rough rivers. He says, likewise, that he wrote histories, in large characters, with his own hand, that so his son, without stirring out of the house, might learn to know about his countrymen and forefathers; nor did he less abstain from speaking anything obscene before his son, than if it had been in the presence of the sacred virgins, called vestals. Nor would he ever go into the bath with him; which seems indeed to have been the common custom of the Romans. Sons-in-law used to avoid bathing with fathers-in-law, disliking to see one another naked; but having, in time, learned of the Greeks to strip before men, they have since taught the Greeks to do it even with the women themselves.

Thus, like an excellent work, Cato formed and fashioned his son to virtue; nor had he any occasion to find fault with his readiness and docility; but as he proved to be of too weak a constitution for hardships, he did not insist on requiring of him any very austere way of living. However, though delicate in health, he proved a stout man in the field, and behaved himself valiantly when Paulus Aemilius fought against Perseus; where when his sword was struck from him by a blow, or rather slipped out of his hand by reason of its moistness, he so keenly resented it, that he turned to some of his friends about him, and taking them along with him again fell upon the enemy; and having by a long fight and much force cleared the place, at length found it among great heaps of arms, and the dead bodies of friends as well as enemies piled one upon another. Upon which Paulus, his general, much commended the youth; and there is a letter of Cato's to his son, which highly praised his honourable eagerness for the recovery of his sword. Afterwards he married Tertia, Aemilius Paulus's daughter, and sister to Scipio; nor was he admitted into this family less for his own worth than his father's. So that Cato's care in his son's education came to a very fitting result.

He purchased a great many slaves out of the captives taken in war, but chiefly brought up the young ones, who were capable to be, as it were, broken and taught like whelps and colts. None of these ever entered another man's house, except sent either by Cato himself or his wife. If any one of them were asked what Cato did, they answered merely that they did not know. When a servant was at home, he was obliged either to do some work or sleep, for indeed Cato loved those most who used to lie down often to sleep, accounting them more docile than those who were wakeful, and more fit for anything when they were refreshed with a little slumber. Being also of opinion that the great cause of the laziness and misbehaviour of slaves was their running after their pleasures, he fixed a certain price for them to pay for permission amongst themselves, but would suffer no connections out of the house. At first, when he was but a poor soldier, he would not be difficult in anything which related to his eating, but looked upon it as a pitiful thing to quarrel with a servant for the belly's sake; but afterwards, when he grew richer, and made any feasts for his friends and colleagues in office, as soon as supper was over he used to go with a leather thong and scourge those who had waited or dressed the meat carelessly. He always contrived, too, that his servants should have some difference one among another, always suspecting and fearing a good understanding between them. Those who had committed anything worthy of death, he punished if they were found guilty by the verdict of their fellow-servants. But being after all much given to the desire of gain, he looked upon agriculture rather as a pleasure than profit; resolving, therefore, to lay out his money in safe and solid things, he purchased ponds, hot baths, grounds full of fuller's earth, remunerative lands, pastures, and woods; from all which he drew large returns, nor could Jupiter himself, he used to say, do him much damage. He was also given to the form of usury, which is considered most odious, in traffic by sea; and that thus:- he desired that those whom he put out his money to should have many partners; when the number of them and their ships came to be fifty, he himself took one share through Quintio his freedman, who therefore was to sail with the adventurers, and take a part in all their proceedings, so that thus there was no danger of losing his whole stock, but only a little part, and that with a prospect of great profit. He likewise lent money to those of his slaves who wished to borrow, with which they bought also other young ones, whom, when they had taught and bred up at his charges, they would sell again at the year's end; but some of them Cato would keep for himself, giving just as much for them as another had offered. To incline his son to be of his kind or temper, he used to tell him that it was not like a man, but rather like a widow woman, to lessen an estate, But the strongest indication of Cato's avaricious humour was when he took the boldness to affirm that he was a most wonderful, nay, a godlike man, who left more behind him than he had received.

He was now grown old, when Carneades the Academic, and Diogenes the Stoic, came as deputies from Athens to Rome, praying for release from a penalty of five hundred talents laid on the Athenians, in a suit, to which they did not appear, in which the Oropians were plaintiffs and Sicyonians judges. All the most studious youth immediately waited on these philosophers, and frequently, with admiration, heard them speak. But the gracefulness of Carneades's oratory, whose ability was really greatest, and his reputation equal to it, gathered large and favourable audiences, and ere long filled, like a wind, all the city with the sound of it. So that it soon began to be told that a Greek, famous even to admiration, winning and carrying all before him, had impressed so strange a love upon the young men, that quitting all their pleasures and pastimes, they ran mad, as it were, after philosophy; which indeed much pleased the Romans in general; nor could they but with much pleasure see the youth receive so welcomely the Greek literature, and frequent the company of learned men. But Cato, on the other side, seeing the passion for words flowing into the city, from the beginning took it ill, fearing lest the youth should be diverted that way, and so should prefer the glory of speaking well before that of arms and doing well. And when the fame of the philosophers increased in the city, and Caius Acilius, a person of distinction, at his own request, became their interpreter to the senate at their first audience, Cato resolved, under some specious pretence, to have all philosophers cleared out of the city; and, coming into the senate, blamed the magistrates for letting these deputies stay so long a time without being despatched, though they were persons that could easily persuade the people to what they pleased; that therefore in all haste something should be determined about their petition, that so they might go home again to their own schools, and declaim to the Greek children, and leave the Roman youth to be obedient, as hitherto, to their own laws and governors.

Yet he did this not out of any anger, as some think, to Carneades; but because he wholly despised philosophy, and out of a kind of pride scoffed at the Greek studies and literature; as, for example, he would say, that Socrates was a prating, seditious fellow, who did his best to tyrannize over his country, to undermine the ancient customs, and to entice and withdraw the citizens to opinions contrary to the laws. Ridiculing the school of Isocrates, he would add, that his scholars grew old men before they had done learning with him, as if they were to use their art and plead causes in the court of Minos in the next world. And to frighten his son from anything that was Greek, in a more vehement tone than became one of his age, he pronounced, as it were, with the voice of an oracle, that the Romans would certainly be destroyed when they began once to be infected with Greek literature; though time indeed has shown the vanity of this his prophecy; as, in truth, the city of Rome has risen to its highest fortune while entertaining Grecian learning. Nor had he an aversion only against the Greek philosophers, but the physicians also; for having, it seems, heard how Hippocrates, when the king of Persia sent for him, with offers of a fee of several talents, said, that he would never assist barbarians who were enemies to the Greeks; he affirmed, that this was now become a common oath taken by all physicians, and enjoined his son to have a care and avoid them; for that he himself had written a little book of prescriptions for curing those who were sick in his family; he never enjoined fasting to any one, but ordered them either vegetables, or the meat of a duck, pigeon, or leveret; such kind of diet being of light digestion and fit for sick folks, only it made those who ate it dream a little too much; and by the use of this kind of physic, he said, he not only made himself and those about him well, but kept them so.

However, for this his presumption he seemed not to have escaped unpunished; for he lost both his wife and his son; though he himself, being of a strong, robust constitution, held out longer; so that he would often, even in his old days, address himself to women, and when he was past a lover's age, married a young woman, upon the following pretence: Having lost his own wife, he married his son to the daughter of Paulus Aemilius, who was sister to Scipio; so that being now a widower himself, he had a young girl who came privately to visit him, but the house being very small, and a daughter-in-law also in it, this practice was quickly discovered; for the young woman seeming once to pass through it a little too boldly, the youth, his son, though he said nothing, seemed to look somewhat indignantly upon her. The old man perceiving and understanding that what he did was disliked, without finding any fault or saying a word, went away, as his custom was, with his usual companions to the market: and among the rest, he called aloud to one Salonius, who had been a clerk under him, and asked him whether he had married his daughter? He answered no, nor would he, till he had consulted him. Said Cato, ""Then I have found out a fit son-in-law for you, if he should not displease by reason of his age; for in all other points there is no fault to be found in him; but he is indeed, as I said, extremely old."" However, Salonius desired him to undertake the business, and to give the young girl to whom he pleased, she being a humble servant of his, who stood in need of his care and patronage. Upon this Cato, without any more ado, told him he desired to have the damsel himself. These words, as may well be imagined, at first astonished the man, conceiving that Cato was as far off from marrying, as he from a likelihood of being allied to the family of one who had been consul and had triumphed; but perceiving him in earnest, he consented willingly; and going onwards to the forum, they quickly completed the bargain.

Whilst the marriage was in hand, Cato's son, taking some of his friends along with him, went and asked his father if it were for any offence he brought in a stepmother upon him? But Cato cried out, ""Far from it, my son, I have no fault to find with you or anything of yours; only I desire to have many children, and to leave the commonwealth more such citizens as you are."" Pisistratus, the tyrant of Athens, made, they say, this answer to his sons, when they were grown men, when he married his second wife, Timonassa of Argos, by whom he had, it is said, Iophon and Thessalus. Cato had a son by this second wife, to whom, from his mother, he gave the surname of Salonius. In the meantime, his eldest died in his praetorship; of whom Cato often makes mention in his books, as having been a good man. He is said, however, to have borne the loss moderately and like a philosopher, and was nothing the more remiss in attending to affairs of state; so that he did not, as Lucius Lucullus and Metellus Pius did, grow languid in his old age, as though public business were a duty once to be discharged, and then quitted; nor did he, like Scipio Africanus, because envy had struck at his glory, turn from the public, and change and pass away the rest of his life without doing anything; but as one persuaded Dionysius, that the most honourable tomb he could have would be to die in the exercise of his dominion; so Cato thought that old age to be the most honourable which was busied in public affairs; though he would, now and then, when he had leisure, recreate himself with husbandry and writing.

And, indeed, he composed various books and histories; and in his youth he addicted himself to agriculture for profit's sake; for he used to say he had but two ways of getting- agriculture and parsimony; and now, in his old age, the first of these gave him both occupation and a subject of study. He wrote one book on country matters, in which he treated particularly even of making cakes and preserving fruit; it being his ambition to be curious and singular in all things. His suppers, at his country house, used also to be plentiful; he daily invited his friends and neighbours about him, and passed the time merrily with them; so that his company was not only agreeable to those of the same age, but even to younger men; for he had had experience in many things, and had been concerned in much, both by word and deed, that was worth the hearing. He looked upon a good table as the best place for making friends; where the commendations of brave and good citizens were usually introduced, and little said of base and unworthy ones; as Cato would not give leave in his company to have anything, either good or ill, said about them.

Some will have the overthrow of Carthage to have been one of his last acts of state; when, indeed, Scipio the younger did by his valour give it the last blow, but the war, chiefly by the counsel and advice of Cato, was undertaken on the following occasion. Cato was sent to the Carthaginians and Masinissa, King of Numidia, who were at war with one another, to know the cause of their difference. He, it seems, had been a friend of the Romans from the beginning; and they, too, since they were conquered by Scipio, were of the Roman confederacy, having been shorn of their power by loss of territory and a heavy tax. Finding Carthage, not (as the Romans thought) low and in an ill condition, but well manned, full of riches and all sorts of arms and ammunition, and perceiving the Carthaginians carry it high, he conceived that it was not a time for the Romans to adjust affairs between them and Masinissa; but rather that they themselves would fall into danger, unless they should find means to check this rapid new growth of Rome's ancient irreconcilable enemy. Therefore, returning quickly to Rome, he acquainted the senate that the former defeats and blows given to the Carthaginians had not so much diminished their strength, as it had abated their imprudence and folly; that they were not become weaker, but more experienced in war, and did only skirmish with the Numidians to exercise themselves the better to cope with the Romans: that the peace and league they had made was but a kind of suspension of war which awaited a fairer opportunity to break out again.
Moreover, they say that, shaking his gown, he took occasion to let drop some African figs before the senate. And on their admiring the size and beauty of them, he presently added, that the place that bore them was but three days' sail from Rome. Nay, he never after this gave his opinion, but at the end he would be sure to come out with this sentence, ""ALSO, CARTHAGE, METHINKS, OUGHT UTTERLY TO BE Destroyed."" But Publius Scipio Nasica would always declare his opinion to the contrary, in these words, ""It seems requisite to me that Carthage should still stand."" For seeing his countrymen to be grown wanton and insolent, and the people made, by their prosperity, obstinate and disobedient to the senate, and drawing the whole city, whither they would, after them, he would have had the fear of Carthage to serve as a bit to hold the contumacy of the multitude; and he looked upon the Carthaginians as too weak to overcome the Romans, and too great to be despised by them. On the other side, it seemed a perilous thing to Cato that a city which had been always great, and was now grown sober and wise, by reason of its former calamities, should still lie, as it were, in wait for the follies and dangerous excesses of the over-powerful Roman people; so that he thought it the wisest course to have all outward dangers removed, when they had so many inward ones among themselves.

Thus Cato, they say, stirred up the third and last war against the Carthaginians: but no sooner was the said war begun, than he died, prophesying of the person that should put an end to it who was then only a young man; but, being tribune in the army, he in several fights gave proof of his courage and conduct. The news of which being brought to Cato's ears at Rome, he thus expressed himself:-

""The only wise man of them all is he,
The others e'en as shadows flit and flee."" This prophecy Scipio soon confirmed by his actions.

Cato left no posterity, except one son by his second wife, who was named, as we said, Cato Salonius; and a grandson by his eldest son, who died. Cato Salonius died when he was praetor, but his son Marcus was afterwards consul, and he was grandfather of Cato the philosopher, who for virtue and renown was one of the most eminent personages of his time.",502859,en,en,en,marcus cato we are told was born at tusculum though till he betook himself to civil and military affairs he lived and was bred up in the country of the sabines where his fathers estate lay his ancestors seeming almost entirely unknown he himself praises his father marcus as a worthy man and a brave soldier and cato his greatgrandfather too as one who had often obtained military prizes and who having lost five horses under him received on the account of his valour the worth of them out of the public exchequer now it being the custom among the romans to call those who having no repute by birth made themselves eminent by their own exertions new men or upstarts they called even cato himself so and so he confessed himself to be as to any public distinction or employment but yet asserted that in the exploits and virtues of his ancestors he was very ancient his third name originally was not cato but priscus though afterwards he had the surname of cato by reason of his abilities for the romans call a skilful or experienced man catus he was of a ruddy complexion and greyeyed as the writer who with no goodwill made the following epigram upon him lets us see porcius who snarls at all in every place with his grey eyes and with his fiery face even after death will scarce admitted be into the infernal realms by hecate he gained in early life a good habit of body by working with his own hands and living temperately and serving in war and seemed to have an equal proportion both of health and strength and he exerted and practised his eloquence through all the neighbourhood and little villages thinking it as requisite as a second body and an all but necessary organ to one who looks forward to something above a mere humble and inactive life he would never refuse to be counsel for those who needed him and was indeed early reckoned a good lawyer and ere long a capable orator hence his solidity and depth of character showed itself gradually more and more to those with whom he was concerned and claimed as it were employment in great affairs and places of public command nor did he merely abstain from taking fees for his counsel and pleading but did not even seem to put any high price on the honour which proceeded from such kind of combats seeming much more desirous to signalize himself in the camp and in real fights and while yet but a youth had his breast covered with scars he had received from the enemy being as he himself says but seventeen years old when he made his first campaign in the time when hannibal in the height of his success was burning and pillaging all italy in engagements he would strike boldly without flinching stand firm to his ground fix a bold countenance upon his enemies and with a harsh threatening voice accost them justly thinking himself and telling others that such a rugged kind of behaviour sometimes terrifies the enemy more than the sword itself in his marches he bore his own arms on foot whilst one servant only followed to carry the provision for his table with whom he is said never to have been angry or hasty whilst he made ready his dinner or supper but would for the most part when he was free from military duty assist and help him himself to dress it when he was with the army he used to drink only water unless perhaps when extremely thirsty he might mingle it with a little vinegar or if he found his strength fail him take a little wine the little country house of manius curius who had been thrice carried in triumph happened to be near his farm so that often going thither and contemplating the small compass of the place and plainness of the dwelling he formed an idea of the mind of the person who being one of the greatest of the romans and having subdued the most warlike nations nay had driven pyrrhus out of italy now after three triumphs was contented to dig in so small a piece of ground and live in such a cottage here it was that the ambassadors of the samnites finding him boiling turnips in the chimney corner offered him a present of gold but he sent them away with this saying that he who was content with such a supper had no need of gold and that he thought it more honourable to conquer those who possessed the gold than to possess the gold itself cato after reflecting upon these things used to return and reviewing his own farm his servants and housekeeping increase his labour and retrench all superfluous expenses when fabius maximus took tarentum cato being then but a youth was a soldier under him and being lodged with one nearchus a pythagorean desired to understand some of his doctrine and hearing from him the language which plato also uses that pleasure is evils chief bait the body the principal calamity of the soul and that those thoughts which most separate and take it off from the affections of the body most enfranchise and purify it he fell in love the more with frugality and temperance with this exception he is said not to have studied greek until when he was pretty old and in rhetoric to have then profited a little by thucydides but more by demosthenes his writings however are considerably embellished with greek sayings and stories nay many of these translated word for word are placed with his own opophthegms and sentences there was a man of the highest rank and very influential among the romans called valerius flaccus who was singularly skilful in discerning excellence yet in the bud and also much disposed to nourish and advance it he it seems had lands bordering upon catos nor could he but admire when he understood from his servants the manner of his living how he laboured with his own hands went on foot betimes in the morning to the courts to assist those who wanted his counsel how returning home again when it was winter he would throw a loose frock over his shoulders and in the summer time would work without anything on among his domestics sit down with them eat of the same bread and drink of the same wine when they spoke also of other good qualities his fair dealing and moderation mentioning also some of his wise sayings he ordered that he should be invited to supper and thus becoming personally assured of his fine temper and his superior character which like a plant seemed only to require culture and a better situation he urged and persuaded him to apply himself to state affairs at rome thither therefore he went and by his pleading soon gained many friends and admirers but valerius chiefly assisting his promotion he first of all got appointed tribune in the army and afterwards was made quaestor or treasurer and now becoming eminent and noted he passed with valerius himself through the greatest commands being first his colleague as consul and then censor but among all the ancient senators he most attached himself to fabius maximus not so much for the honour of his person and the greatness of his power as that he might have before him his habit and manner of life as the best examples to follow and so he did not hesitate to oppose scipio the great who being then but a young man seemed to set himself against the power of fabius and to be envied by him for being sent together with him as treasurer when he saw him according to his natural custom make great expenses and distribute among the soldiers without sparing he freely told him that the expense in itself was not the greatest thing to be considered but that he was corrupting the frugality of the soldiers by giving them the means to abandon themselves to unnecessary pleasures and luxuries scipio answered that he had no need for so accurate a treasurer bearing on as he was so to say full sail to the war and that he owed the people an account of his actions and not of the money he spent hereupon cato returned from sicily and together with fabius made loud complaints in the open senate of scipios lavishing unspeakable sums and childishly loitering away his time in wrestling matches and comedies as if he were not to make war but holiday and thus succeeded in getting some of the tribunes of the people sent to call him back to rome in case the accusations should prove true but scipio demonstrating as it were to them by his preparations the coming victory and being found merely to be living pleasantly with his friends when there was nothing else to do but in no respect because of that easiness and liberality at all the more negligent in things of consequence and moment without impediment set sail toward the war cato grew more and more powerful by his eloquence so that he was commonly called the roman demosthenes but his manner of life was yet more famous and talked of for oratorical skill was as an accomplishment commonly studied and sought after by all young men but he was very rare who would cultivate the old habits of bodily labour or prefer a light supper and a breakfast which never saw the fire or be in love with poor clothes and a homely lodging or could set his ambition rather on doing without luxuries than on possessing them for now the state unable to keep its purity by reason of its greatness and having so many affairs and people from all parts under its government was fain to admit many mixed customers and new examples of living with reason therefore everybody admired cato when they saw others sink under labours and grow effeminate by pleasures and yet beheld him unconquered by either and that not only when he was young and desirous of honour but also when old and greyheaded after a consulship and triumph like some famous victor in the games persevering in his exercise and maintaining his character to the very last he himself says that he never wore a suit of clothes which cost more than a hundred drachmas and that when he was general and consul he drank the same wine which his workmen did and that the meat or fish which was bought in the meatmarket for his dinner did not cost above thirty asses all which was for the sake of the commonwealth that so his body might be the hardier for the war having a piece of embroidered babylonian tapestry left him he sold it because none of his farmhouses were so much as plastered nor did he ever buy a slave for above fifteen hundred drachmas as he did not seek for effeminate and handsome ones but able sturdy workmen horsekeepers and cowherds and these he thought ought to be sold again when they grew old and no useless servants fed in the house in short he reckoned nothing a good bargain which was superfluous but whatever it was though sold for a farthing he would think it a great price if you had no need of it and was for the purchase of lands for sowing and feeding rather than grounds for sweeping and watering some imputed these things to petty avarice but others approved of him as if he had only the more strictly denied himself for the rectifying and amending of others yet certainly in my judgment it marks an overrigid temper for a man to take the work out of his servants as out of brute beasts turning them off and selling them in their old age and thinking there ought to be no further commerce between man and man than whilst there arises some profit by it we see that kindness or humanity has a larger field than bare justice to exercise itself in law and justice we cannot in the nature of things employ on others than men but we may extend our goodness and charity even to irrational creatures and such acts flow from a gentle nature as water from an abundant spring it is doubtless the part of a kindnatured man to keep even wornout horses and dogs and not only take care of them when they are foals and whelps but also when they are grown old the athenians when they built their hecatompedon turned those mules loose to feed freely which they had observed to have done the hardest labour one of these they say came once of itself to offer its service and ran along with nay and went before the teams which drew the wagons up to the acropolis as if it would incite and encourage them to draw more stoutly upon which there passed a vote that the creature should be kept at the public charge even till it died the graves of cimons horses which thrice won the olympian races are yet to be seen close by his own monument old xanthippus too amongst many others who buried the dogs they had bred up entombed his which swam after his galley to salamis when the people fled from athens on the top of a cliff which they call the dogs tomb to this day nor are we to use living creatures like old shoes or dishes and throw them away when they are worn out or broken with service but if it were for nothing else but by way of study and practice in humanity a man ought always to prehabituate himself in these things to be of a kind and sweet disposition as to myself i would not so much as sell my draught ox on the account of his age much less for a small piece of money sell a poor old man and so chase him as it were from his own country by turning him not only out of the place where he has lived a long while but also out of the manner of living he has been accustomed to and that more especially when he would be as useless to the buyer as to the seller yet cato for all this glories that he left that very horse in spain which he used in the wars when he was consul only because he would not put the public to the charge of his freight whether these acts are to be ascribed to the greatness or pettiness of his spirit let every one argue as they please for his general temperance however and selfcontrol he really deserves the highest admiration for when he commanded the army he never took for himself and those that belonged to him above three bushels of wheat for a month and somewhat less than a bushel and a half a day of barley for his baggagecattle and when he entered upon the government of sardinia where his predecessors had been used to require tents bedding and clothes upon the public account and to charge the state heavily with the cost of provisions and entertainments for a great train of servants and friends the difference he showed in his economy was something incredible there was nothing of any sort for which he put the public to expense he would walk without a carriage to visit the cities with one only of the common town officers who carried his dress and a cup to offer libation with yet though he seemed thus easy and sparing to all who were under his power he on the other hand showed most inflexible severity and strictness in what related to public justice and was rigorous and precise in what concerned the ordinances of the commonwealth so that the roman government never seemed more terrible nor yet more mild than under his administration his very manner of speaking seemed to have such a kind of idea with it for it was courteous and yet forcible pleasant yet overwhelming facetious yet austere sententious and yet vehement like socrates in the description of plato who seemed outwardly to those about him to be but a simple talkative blunt fellow whilst at the bottom he was full of such gravity and matter as would even move tears and touch the very hearts of his auditors and therefore i know not what has persuaded some to say that catos style was chiefly like that of lysias however let us leave those to judge of these things who profess most to distinguish between the several kinds of oratorical style in latin whilst we write down some of his memorable sayings being of the opinion that a mans character appears much more by his words than as some think it does by his looks being once desirous to dissuade the common people of rome from their unseasonable and impetuous clamour for largesses and distributions of corn he began thus to harangue them it is a difficult task o citizens to make speeches to the belly which has no ears reproving also their sumptuous habits he said it was hard to preserve a city where a fish sold for more than an ox he had a saying also that the roman people were like sheep for they when single do not obey but when altogether in a flock they follow their leaders so you said he when you have got together in a body let yourselves be guided by those whom singly you would never think of being advised by discoursing of the power of women men said he usually command women but we command all men and the women command us but this indeed is borrowed from the sayings of themistocles who when his son was making many demands of him by means of the mother said o woman the athenians govern the greeks i govern the athenians but you govern me and your son governs you so let him use his power sparingly since simple as he is he can do more than all the greeks together another saying of catos was that the roman people did not only fix the value of such and such purple dyes but also of such and such habits of life for said he as dyers most of all dye such colours as they see to be most agreeable so the young men learn and zealously affect what is most popular with you he also exhorted them that if they were grown great by their virtue and temperance they should not change for the worse but if intemperance and vice had made them great they should change for the better for by that means they were grown indeed quite great enough he would say likewise of men who wanted to be continually in office that apparently they did not know their road since they could not do without beadles to guide them on it he also reproved the citizens for choosing still the same men as their magistrates for you will seem said he either not to esteem government worth much or to think few worthy to hold it speaking too of a certain enemy of his who lived a very base and discreditable life it is considered he said rather as a curse than a blessing on him that this fellows mother prays that she may leave him behind her pointing at one who had sold the land which his father had left him and which lay near the seaside he pretended to express his wonder at his being stronger even than the sea itself for what it washed away with a great deal of labour he with a great deal of ease drank away when the senate with a great deal of splendour received king eumenes on his visit to rome and the chief citizens strove who should be most about him cato appeared to regard him with suspicion and apprehension and when one that stood by too took occasion to say that he was a very good prince and a great lover of the romans it may be so said cato but by nature this same animal of a king is a kind of maneater nor indeed were there ever kings who deserved to be compared with epaminondas pericles themistocles manius curius or hamilcar surnamed barcas he used to say too that his enemies envied him because he had to get up every day before light and neglect his own business to follow that of the public he would also tell you that he had rather be deprived of the reward for doing well than not to suffer the punishment for doing ill and that he could pardon all offenders but himself the romans having sent three ambassadors to bithynia of whom one was gouty another had his skull trepanned and the other seemed little better than a fool cato laughing gave out that the romans had sent an embassy which had neither feet head nor heart his interest being entreated by scipio on account of polybius for the achaean exiles and there happening to be a great discussion in the senate about it some being for and some against their return cato standing up thus delivered himself here do we sit all day long as if we had nothing to do but beat our brains whether these old greeks should be carried to their graves by the bearers here or by those in achaea the senate voting their return it seems that a few days after polybiuss friends further wished that it should be further moved in the senate that the said banished persons should receive again the honours which they first had in achaea and to this purpose they sounded cato for his opinion but he smiling answered that polybius ulysses like having escaped out of the cyclops den wanted it would seem to go back again because he had left his cap and belt behind him he used to assert also that wise men profited more by fools than fools by wise men for that wise men avoided the faults of fools but that fools would not imitate the good examples of wise men he would profess too that he was more taken with young men that blushed than with those who looked pale and that he never desired to have a soldier that moved his hands too much in marching and his feet too much in fighting or snored louder than he shouted ridiculing a fat overgrown man what use said he can the state turn a mans body to when all between the throat and groin is taken up by the belly when one who was much given to pleasures desired his acquaintance begging his pardon he said he could not live with a man whose palate was of a quicker sense than his heart he would likewise say that the soul of a lover lived in the body of another and that in his whole life he most repented of three things one was that he had trusted a secret to a woman another that he went by water when he might have gone by land the third that he had remained one whole day without doing any business of moment applying himself to an old man who was committing some vice friend said he old age has of itself blemishes enough do not you add to it the deformity of vice speaking to a tribune who was reputed a poisoner and was very violent for the bringing in of a bill in order to make a certain law young man cried he i know not which would be better to drink what you mix or confirm what you would put up for a law being reviled by a fellow who lived a profligate and wicked life a contest replied he is unequal between you and me for you can hear ill words easily and can as easily give them but it is unpleasant to me to give such and unusual to hear them such was his manner of expressing himself in his memorable sayings being chosen consul with his friend and familiar valerius flaccus the government of that part of spain which the romans called the hither spain fell to his lot here as he was engaged in reducing some of the tribes by force and bringing over others by good words a large army of barbarians fell upon him so that there was danger of being disgracefully forced out again he therefore called upon his neighbours the celtiberians for help and on their demanding two hundred talents for their assistance everybody else thought it intolerable that even the romans should promise barbarians a reward for their aid but cato said there was no discredit or harm in it for if they overcame they would pay them out of the enemys purse and not out of their own but if they were overcome there would be nobody left either to demand the reward or to pay it however he won that battle completely and after that all his other affairs succeeded splendidly polybius says that by his command the walls of all the cities on this side the river baetis were in one days time demolished and yet there were a great many of them full of brave and warlike men cato himself says that he took more cities than he stayed days in spain neither is this a mere rhodomontade if it be true that the number was four hundred and though the soldiers themselves had got much in the fights yet he distributed a pound of silver to every man of them saying it was better that many of the romans should return home with silver rather than a few with gold for himself he affirms that of all the things that were taken nothing came to him beyond what he ate and drank neither do i find fault continued he with those that seek to profit by these spoils but i had rather compete in valour with the best than in wealth with the richest or with the most covetous in love of money nor did he merely keep himself clear from taking anything but even all those who more immediately belonged to him he had five servants with him in the army one of whom called paccus bought three boys out of those who were taken captive which cato coming to understand the man rather than venture into his presence hanged himself cato sold the boys and carried the price he got for them into the public exchequer scipio the great being his enemy and desiring whilst he was carrying all things so successfully to obstruct him and take the affairs of spain into his own hands succeeded in getting himself appointed his successor in the government and making all possible haste put a term to catos authority but he taking with him a convoy of five cohorts of foot and five hundred horse to attend him home overthrew by the way the lacetanians and taking from them six hundred deserters caused them all to be beheaded upon which scipio seemed to be in indignation but cato in mock disparagement of himself said rome would become great indeed if the most honourable and great men would not yield up the first place of valour to those who were more obscure and when they who were of the commonalty as he himself was would contend in valour with those who were most eminent in birth and honour the senate having voted to change nothing of what had been established by cato the government passed away under scipio to no manner of purpose in idleness and doing nothing and so diminished his credit much more than catos nor did cato who now received a triumph remit after this and slacken the reins of virtue as many do who strive not so much for virtues sake as for vainglory and having attained the highest honours as the consulship and triumphs pass the rest of their life in pleasure and idleness and quit all public affairs but he like those who are just entered upon public life for the first time and thirst after gaining honour and glory in some new office strained himself as if he were but just setting out and offering still publicly his service to his friends and citizens would give up neither his pleadings nor his soldiery he accompanied and assisted tiberius sempronius as his lieutenant when he went into thrace and to the danube and in the quality of tribune went with manius acilius into greece against antiochus the great who after hannibal more than any one struck terror into the romans for having reduced once more under a single command almost the whole of asia all namely that seleucus nicator had possessed and having brought into obedience many warlike nations of the barbarians he longed to fall upon the romans as if they only were now worthy to fight with him so across he came with his forces pretending as a specious cause of the war that it was to free the greeks who had indeed no need of it they having been but newly delivered from the power of king philip and the macedonians and made independent with the free use of their own laws by the goodness of the romans themselves so that all greece was in commotion and excitement having been corrupted by the hopes of royal aid which the popular leaders in their cities put them into manius therefore sent ambassadors to the different cities and titus flaminius as is written in the account of him suppressed and quieted most of the attempts of the innovators without any trouble cato brought over the corinthians those of patrae and aegium and spent a good deal of time at athens there is also an oration of his said to be extant which he spoke in greek to the people in which he expressed his admiration of the virtue of the ancient athenians and signified that he came with a great deal of pleasure to be a spectator of the beauty and greatness of their city but this is a fiction for he spoke to the athenians by an interpreter though he was able to have spoken himself but he wished to observe the usage of his own country and laughed at those who admired nothing but what was in greek jesting upon postumius albinus who had written an historical work in greek and requested that allowances might be made for his attempt he said that allowance indeed might be made if he had done it under the express compulsion of an amphictyonic decree the athenians he says admired the quickness and vehemence of his speech for an interpreter would be very long in repeating what he expressed with a great deal of brevity but on the whole he professed to believe that the words of the greeks came only from their lips whilst those of the romans came from their hearts now antiochus having occupied with his army the narrow passages about thermopylae and added palisades and walls to the natural fortifications of the place sat down there thinking he had done enough to divert the war and the romans indeed seemed wholly to despair of forcing the passage but cato calling to mind the compass and circuit which the persians had formerly made to come at this place went forth in the night taking along with him part of the army whilst they were climbing up the guide who was a prisoner missed the way and wandering up and down by impracticable and precipitous paths filled the soldiers with fear and despondency cato perceiving the danger commanded all the rest to halt and stay where they were whilst he himself taking along with him one lucius manlius a most expert man at climbing mountains went forward with a great deal of labour and danger in the dark night and without the least moonshine among the wild olivetrees and steep craggy rocks there being nothing but precipices and darkness before their eyes till they struck into a little pass which they thought might lead down into the enemys camp there they put up marks upon some conspicuous peaks which surmount the hill called callidromon and returning again they led the army along with them to the said marks till they got into their little path again and there once made a halt but when they began to go further the path deserted them at a precipice where they were in another strait and fear nor did they perceive that they were all this while near the enemy and now the day began to give some light when they seemed to hear a noise and presently after to see the greek trenches and the guard at the foot of the rock here therefore cato halted his forces and commanded the troops from firmum only without the rest to stick by him as he had always found them faithful and ready and when they came up and formed around him in close order he thus spoke to them i desire he said to take one of the enemy alive that so i may understand what men these are who guard the passage their number and with what discipline order and preparation they expect us but this feat continued he must be an act of a great deal of quickness and boldness such as that of lions when they dart upon some timorous animal cato had no sooner thus expressed himself but the firmans forthwith rushed down the mountain just as they were upon the guard and falling unexpectedly upon them affrighted and dispersed them all one armed man they took and brought to cato who quickly learned from him that the rest of the forces lay in the narrow passage about the king that those who kept the tops of the rocks were six hundred choice aetolians cato therefore despising the smallness of their number and carelessness forthwith drawing his sword fell upon them with a great noise of trumpets and shouting the enemy perceiving them thus tumbling as it were upon them from the precipices flew to the main body and put all things into disorder there in the meantime whilst manius was forcing the works below and pouring the thickest of his forces into the narrow passages antiochus was hit in the mouth with a stone so that his teeth being beaten out by it he felt such excessive pain that he was fain to turn away with his horse nor did any part of his army stand the shock of the romans yet though there seemed no reasonable hope of flight where all paths were so difficult and where there were deep marshes and steep rocks which looked as if they were ready to receive those who should stumble the fugitives nevertheless crowding and pressing together in the narrow passages destroyed even one another in their terror of the swords and blows of the enemy cato as it plainly appears was never oversparing of his own praises and seldom shunned boasting of any exploit which quality indeed he seems to have thought the natural accompaniment of great actions and with these particular exploits he was highly puffed up he says that those who saw him that day pursuing and slaying the enemies were ready to assert that cato owed not so much to the public as the public did to cato nay he adds that manius the consul coming hot from the fight embraced him for a great while when both were all in a sweat and then cried out with joy that neither he himself no nor all the people together could make him a recompense equal to his actions after the fight he was sent to rome that he himself might be the messenger of it and so with a favourable wind he sailed to brundusium and in one day got from thence to tarentum and having travelled four days more upon the fifth counting from the time of his landing he arrived at rome and so brought the first news of the victory himself and filled the whole city with joy and sacrifices and the people with the belief that they were able to conquer every sea and every land these are pretty nearly all the eminent actions of cato relating to military affairs in civil policy he was of opinion that one chief duty consisted in accusing and indicting criminals he himself prosecuted many and he would also assist others who prosecuted them nay would even procure such as he did the petilii against scipio but not being able to destroy him by reason of the nobleness of his family and the real greatness of his mind which enabled him to trample all calumnies under foot cato at last would meddle no more with him yet joining with the accusers against scipios brother lucius he succeeded in obtaining a sentence against him which condemned him to the payment of a large sum of money to the state and being insolvent and in danger of being thrown into jail he was by the interposition of the tribunes of the people with much ado dismissed it is also said of cato that when he met a certain youth who had effected the disgrace of one of his fathers enemies walking in the marketplace he shook him by the hand telling him that this was what we ought to sacrifice to our dead parents not lambs and goats but the tears and condemnations of their adversaries but neither did he himself escape with impunity in his management of affairs for if he gave his enemies but the least hold he was still in danger and exposed to be brought to justice he is reported to have escaped at least fifty indictments and one above the rest which was the last when he was eightysix years old about which time he uttered the wellknown saying that it was hard for him who had lived with one generation of men to plead now before another neither did he make this the least of his lawsuits for four years after when he was fourscore and ten he accused servilius galba so that his life and actions extended we may say as nestors did over three ordinary ages of man for having had many contests as we have related with scipio the great about affairs of state he continued them down to scipio the younger who was the adopted grandson of the former and the son of that paulus who overthrew perseus and the macedonians ten years after his consulship cato stood for the office of censor which was indeed the summit of all honour and in a manner the highest step in civil affairs for besides all other power it had also that of an inquisition into every ones life and manners for the romans thought that no marriage or rearing of children nay no feast or drinkingbout ought to be permitted according to every ones appetite or fancy without being examined and inquired into being indeed of opinion that a mans character was much sooner perceived in things of this sort than in what is done publicly and in open day they chose therefore two persons one out of the patricians the other out of the commons who were to watch correct and punish if any one ran too much into voluptuousness or transgressed the usual manner of life of his country and these they called censors they had power to take away a horse or expel out of the senate any one who lived intemperately and out of order it was also their business to take an estimate of what every one was worth and to put down in registers everybodys birth and quality besides many other prerogatives and therefore the chief nobility opposed his pretensions to it jealousy prompted the patricians who thought that it would be a stain to everybodys nobility if men of no original honour should rise to the highest dignity and power while others conscious of their own evil practices and of the violation of the laws and customs of their country were afraid of the austerity of the man which in an office of such great power was likely to prove most uncompromising and severe and so consulting among themselves they brought forward seven candidates in opposition to him who sedulously set themselves to court the peoples favour by fair promises as though what they wished for was indulgent and easy government cato on the contrary promising no such mildness but plainly threatening evil livers from the very hustings openly declared himself and exclaiming that the city needed a great and thorough purgation called upon the people if they were wise not to choose the gentlest but the roughest of physicians such a one he said he was and valerius flaccus one of the patricians another together with him he doubted not but he should do something worth the while and that by cutting to pieces and burning like a hydra all luxury and voluptuousness he added too that he saw all the rest endeavouring after the office with ill intent because they were afraid of those who would exercise it justly as they ought and so truly great and so worthy of great men to be its leaders was it would seem the roman people that they did not fear the severity and grim countenance of cato but rejecting those smooth promisers who were ready to do all things to ingratiate themselves they took him together with flaccus obeying his recommendations not as though he were a candidate but as if he had had the actual power of commanding and governing already cato named as chief of the senate his friend and colleague lucius valerius flaccus and expelled among many others lucius quintius who had been consul seven years before and which was greater honour to him than the consulship brother to that titus flaminius who overthrew king philip the reason he had for his expulsion was this lucius it seems took along with him in all his commands a youth whom he had kept as his companion from the flower of his age and to whom he gave as much power and respect as to the chiefest of his friends and relations now it happened that lucius being consular governor of one of the provinces the youth setting himself down by him as he used to do among other flatteries with which he played upon him when he was in his cups told him he loved him so dearly that though there was a show of gladiators to be seen at rome and i he said had never beheld one in my life and though i as it were longed to see a man killed yet i made all possible haste to come to you upon this lucius returning his fondness replied do not be melancholy on that account i can remedy that ordering therefore forthwith one of those condemned to die to be brought to the feast together with the headsman and axe he asked the youth if he wished to see him executed the boy answering that he did lucius commanded the executioner to cut off his neck and this several historians mention and cicero indeed in his dialogue de senectute introduces cato relating it himself but livy says that he that was killed was a gaulish deserter and that lucius did not execute him by the stroke of the executioner but with his own hand and that it is so stated in catos speech lucius being thus expelled out of the senate by cato his brother took it very ill and appealing to the people desired that cato should declare his reasons and when he began to relate this transaction of the feast lucius endeavoured to deny it but cato challenging him to a formal investigation he fell off and refused it so that he was then acknowledged to suffer deservedly afterwards however when there was some show at the theatre he passed by the seats where those who had been consuls used to be placed and taking his seat a great way off excited the compassion of the common people who presently with a great noise made him go forward and as much as they could tried to set right and salve over what had happened manilius also who according to the public expectation would have been next consul he threw out of the senate because in the presence of his daughter and in open day he had kissed his wife he said that as for himself his wife never came into his arms except when there was great thunder so that it was for jest with him that it was a pleasure for him when jupiter thundered his treatment of lucius likewise the brother of scipio and one who had been honoured with a triumph occasioned some odium against cato for he took his horse from him and was thought to do it with a design of putting an affront on scipio africanus now dead but he gave most general annoyance by retrenching peoples luxury for though most of the youth being thereby already corrupted it seemed almost impossible to take it away with an open hand and directly yet going as it were obliquely around he caused all dress carriages womens ornaments household furniture whose price exceeded one thousand five hundred drachmas to be rated at ten times as much as they were worth intending by thus making the assessments greater to increase the taxes paid upon them he also ordained that upon every thousand asses of property of this kind three should be paid so that people burdened with these extra charges and seeing others of as good estates but more frugal and sparing paying less into the public exchequer might be tried out of their prodigality and thus on the one side not only those were disgusted at cato who bore the taxes for the sake of their luxury but those too who on the other side laid by their luxury for fear of the taxes for people in general reckon that an order not to display their riches is equivalent to the taking away of their riches because riches are seen much more in superfluous than in necessary things indeed this was what excited the wonder of ariston the philosopher that we account those who possess superfluous things more happy than those who abound with what is necessary and useful but when one of his friends asked scopas the rich thessalian to give him some article of no great utility saying that it was not a thing that he had any great need or use for himself in truth replied he it is just these useless and unnecessary things that make my wealth and happiness thus the desire of riches does not proceed from a natural passion within us but arises rather from vulgar outofdoors opinion of other people cato notwithstanding being little solicitous as to those who exclaimed against him increased his austerity he caused the pipes through which some persons brought the public water into their houses and gardens to be cut and threw down all buildings which jutted out into the common streets he beat down also the price in contracts for public works to the lowest and raised it in contracts for farming the taxes to the highest sum by which proceedings he drew a great deal of hatred upon himself those who were of titus flaminiuss party cancelled in the senate all the bargains and contracts made by him for the repairing and carrying on of the sacred and public buildings as unadvantageous to the commonwealth they incited also the boldest of the tribunes of the people to accuse him and to fine him two talents they likewise much opposed him in building the court or basilica which he caused to be erected at the common charge just by the senatehouse in the marketplace and called by his own name the porcian however the people it seems liked his censorship wondrously well for setting up a statue for him in the temple of the goddess of health they put an inscription under it not recording his commands in war or his triumph but to the effect that this was cato the censor who by his good discipline and wise and temperate ordinances reclaimed the roman commonwealth when it was declining and sinking down into vice before this honour was done to himself he used to laugh at those who loved such kind of things saying that they did not see that they were taking pride in the workmanship of brassfounders and painters whereas the citizens bore about his best likeness in their breasts and when any seemed to wonder that he should have never a statue while many ordinary persons had one i would said he much rather be asked why i have not one than why i have one in short he would not have any honest citizen endure to be praised except it might prove advantageous to the commonwealth yet still he had passed the highest commendation on himself for he tells us that those who did anything wrong and were found fault with used to say it was not worth while to blame them for they were not catos he also adds that they who awkwardly mimicked some of his actions were called lefthanded catos and that the senate in perilous times would cast their eyes on him as upon a pilot in a ship and that often when he was not present they put off affairs of greatest consequence these things are indeed also testified of him by others for he had a great authority in the city alike for his life his eloquence and his age he was also a good father an excellent husband to his wife and an extraordinary economist and as he did not manage his affairs of this kind carelessly and as things of little moment i think i ought to record a little further whatever was commendable in him in these points he married a wife more noble than rich being of opinion that the rich and the highborn are equally haughty and proud but that those of noble blood would be more ashamed of base things and consequently more obedient to their husbands in all that was fit and right a man who beat his wife or child laid violent hands he said on what was most sacred and a good husband he reckoned worthy of more praise than a great senator and he admired the ancient socrates for nothing so much as for having lived a temperate and contented life with a wife who was a scold and children who were halfwitted as soon as he had a son born though he had never such urgent business upon his hands unless it were some public matter he would be by when his wife washed it and dressed it in its swaddling clothes for she herself suckled it nay she often too gave her breast to her servants children to produce by suckling the same milk a kind of natural love in them to her son when he began to come to years of discretion cato himself would teach him to read although he had a servant a very good grammarian called chilo who taught many others but he thought not fit as he himself said to have his son reprimanded by a slave or pulled it may be by the ears when found tardy in his lesson nor would he have him owe to a servant the obligation of so great a thing as his learning he himself therefore as we were saying taught him his grammar law and his gymnastic exercises nor did he only show him too how to throw a dart to fight in armour and to ride but to box also and to endure both heat and cold and to swim over the most rapid and rough rivers he says likewise that he wrote histories in large characters with his own hand that so his son without stirring out of the house might learn to know about his countrymen and forefathers nor did he less abstain from speaking anything obscene before his son than if it had been in the presence of the sacred virgins called vestals nor would he ever go into the bath with him which seems indeed to have been the common custom of the romans sonsinlaw used to avoid bathing with fathersinlaw disliking to see one another naked but having in time learned of the greeks to strip before men they have since taught the greeks to do it even with the women themselves thus like an excellent work cato formed and fashioned his son to virtue nor had he any occasion to find fault with his readiness and docility but as he proved to be of too weak a constitution for hardships he did not insist on requiring of him any very austere way of living however though delicate in health he proved a stout man in the field and behaved himself valiantly when paulus aemilius fought against perseus where when his sword was struck from him by a blow or rather slipped out of his hand by reason of its moistness he so keenly resented it that he turned to some of his friends about him and taking them along with him again fell upon the enemy and having by a long fight and much force cleared the place at length found it among great heaps of arms and the dead bodies of friends as well as enemies piled one upon another upon which paulus his general much commended the youth and there is a letter of catos to his son which highly praised his honourable eagerness for the recovery of his sword afterwards he married tertia aemilius pauluss daughter and sister to scipio nor was he admitted into this family less for his own worth than his fathers so that catos care in his sons education came to a very fitting result he purchased a great many slaves out of the captives taken in war but chiefly brought up the young ones who were capable to be as it were broken and taught like whelps and colts none of these ever entered another mans house except sent either by cato himself or his wife if any one of them were asked what cato did they answered merely that they did not know when a servant was at home he was obliged either to do some work or sleep for indeed cato loved those most who used to lie down often to sleep accounting them more docile than those who were wakeful and more fit for anything when they were refreshed with a little slumber being also of opinion that the great cause of the laziness and misbehaviour of slaves was their running after their pleasures he fixed a certain price for them to pay for permission amongst themselves but would suffer no connections out of the house at first when he was but a poor soldier he would not be difficult in anything which related to his eating but looked upon it as a pitiful thing to quarrel with a servant for the bellys sake but afterwards when he grew richer and made any feasts for his friends and colleagues in office as soon as supper was over he used to go with a leather thong and scourge those who had waited or dressed the meat carelessly he always contrived too that his servants should have some difference one among another always suspecting and fearing a good understanding between them those who had committed anything worthy of death he punished if they were found guilty by the verdict of their fellowservants but being after all much given to the desire of gain he looked upon agriculture rather as a pleasure than profit resolving therefore to lay out his money in safe and solid things he purchased ponds hot baths grounds full of fullers earth remunerative lands pastures and woods from all which he drew large returns nor could jupiter himself he used to say do him much damage he was also given to the form of usury which is considered most odious in traffic by sea and that thus he desired that those whom he put out his money to should have many partners when the number of them and their ships came to be fifty he himself took one share through quintio his freedman who therefore was to sail with the adventurers and take a part in all their proceedings so that thus there was no danger of losing his whole stock but only a little part and that with a prospect of great profit he likewise lent money to those of his slaves who wished to borrow with which they bought also other young ones whom when they had taught and bred up at his charges they would sell again at the years end but some of them cato would keep for himself giving just as much for them as another had offered to incline his son to be of his kind or temper he used to tell him that it was not like a man but rather like a widow woman to lessen an estate but the strongest indication of catos avaricious humour was when he took the boldness to affirm that he was a most wonderful nay a godlike man who left more behind him than he had received he was now grown old when carneades the academic and diogenes the stoic came as deputies from athens to rome praying for release from a penalty of five hundred talents laid on the athenians in a suit to which they did not appear in which the oropians were plaintiffs and sicyonians judges all the most studious youth immediately waited on these philosophers and frequently with admiration heard them speak but the gracefulness of carneadess oratory whose ability was really greatest and his reputation equal to it gathered large and favourable audiences and ere long filled like a wind all the city with the sound of it so that it soon began to be told that a greek famous even to admiration winning and carrying all before him had impressed so strange a love upon the young men that quitting all their pleasures and pastimes they ran mad as it were after philosophy which indeed much pleased the romans in general nor could they but with much pleasure see the youth receive so welcomely the greek literature and frequent the company of learned men but cato on the other side seeing the passion for words flowing into the city from the beginning took it ill fearing lest the youth should be diverted that way and so should prefer the glory of speaking well before that of arms and doing well and when the fame of the philosophers increased in the city and caius acilius a person of distinction at his own request became their interpreter to the senate at their first audience cato resolved under some specious pretence to have all philosophers cleared out of the city and coming into the senate blamed the magistrates for letting these deputies stay so long a time without being despatched though they were persons that could easily persuade the people to what they pleased that therefore in all haste something should be determined about their petition that so they might go home again to their own schools and declaim to the greek children and leave the roman youth to be obedient as hitherto to their own laws and governors yet he did this not out of any anger as some think to carneades but because he wholly despised philosophy and out of a kind of pride scoffed at the greek studies and literature as for example he would say that socrates was a prating seditious fellow who did his best to tyrannize over his country to undermine the ancient customs and to entice and withdraw the citizens to opinions contrary to the laws ridiculing the school of isocrates he would add that his scholars grew old men before they had done learning with him as if they were to use their art and plead causes in the court of minos in the next world and to frighten his son from anything that was greek in a more vehement tone than became one of his age he pronounced as it were with the voice of an oracle that the romans would certainly be destroyed when they began once to be infected with greek literature though time indeed has shown the vanity of this his prophecy as in truth the city of rome has risen to its highest fortune while entertaining grecian learning nor had he an aversion only against the greek philosophers but the physicians also for having it seems heard how hippocrates when the king of persia sent for him with offers of a fee of several talents said that he would never assist barbarians who were enemies to the greeks he affirmed that this was now become a common oath taken by all physicians and enjoined his son to have a care and avoid them for that he himself had written a little book of prescriptions for curing those who were sick in his family he never enjoined fasting to any one but ordered them either vegetables or the meat of a duck pigeon or leveret such kind of diet being of light digestion and fit for sick folks only it made those who ate it dream a little too much and by the use of this kind of physic he said he not only made himself and those about him well but kept them so however for this his presumption he seemed not to have escaped unpunished for he lost both his wife and his son though he himself being of a strong robust constitution held out longer so that he would often even in his old days address himself to women and when he was past a lovers age married a young woman upon the following pretence having lost his own wife he married his son to the daughter of paulus aemilius who was sister to scipio so that being now a widower himself he had a young girl who came privately to visit him but the house being very small and a daughterinlaw also in it this practice was quickly discovered for the young woman seeming once to pass through it a little too boldly the youth his son though he said nothing seemed to look somewhat indignantly upon her the old man perceiving and understanding that what he did was disliked without finding any fault or saying a word went away as his custom was with his usual companions to the market and among the rest he called aloud to one salonius who had been a clerk under him and asked him whether he had married his daughter he answered no nor would he till he had consulted him said cato then i have found out a fit soninlaw for you if he should not displease by reason of his age for in all other points there is no fault to be found in him but he is indeed as i said extremely old however salonius desired him to undertake the business and to give the young girl to whom he pleased she being a humble servant of his who stood in need of his care and patronage upon this cato without any more ado told him he desired to have the damsel himself these words as may well be imagined at first astonished the man conceiving that cato was as far off from marrying as he from a likelihood of being allied to the family of one who had been consul and had triumphed but perceiving him in earnest he consented willingly and going onwards to the forum they quickly completed the bargain whilst the marriage was in hand catos son taking some of his friends along with him went and asked his father if it were for any offence he brought in a stepmother upon him but cato cried out far from it my son i have no fault to find with you or anything of yours only i desire to have many children and to leave the commonwealth more such citizens as you are pisistratus the tyrant of athens made they say this answer to his sons when they were grown men when he married his second wife timonassa of argos by whom he had it is said iophon and thessalus cato had a son by this second wife to whom from his mother he gave the surname of salonius in the meantime his eldest died in his praetorship of whom cato often makes mention in his books as having been a good man he is said however to have borne the loss moderately and like a philosopher and was nothing the more remiss in attending to affairs of state so that he did not as lucius lucullus and metellus pius did grow languid in his old age as though public business were a duty once to be discharged and then quitted nor did he like scipio africanus because envy had struck at his glory turn from the public and change and pass away the rest of his life without doing anything but as one persuaded dionysius that the most honourable tomb he could have would be to die in the exercise of his dominion so cato thought that old age to be the most honourable which was busied in public affairs though he would now and then when he had leisure recreate himself with husbandry and writing and indeed he composed various books and histories and in his youth he addicted himself to agriculture for profits sake for he used to say he had but two ways of getting agriculture and parsimony and now in his old age the first of these gave him both occupation and a subject of study he wrote one book on country matters in which he treated particularly even of making cakes and preserving fruit it being his ambition to be curious and singular in all things his suppers at his country house used also to be plentiful he daily invited his friends and neighbours about him and passed the time merrily with them so that his company was not only agreeable to those of the same age but even to younger men for he had had experience in many things and had been concerned in much both by word and deed that was worth the hearing he looked upon a good table as the best place for making friends where the commendations of brave and good citizens were usually introduced and little said of base and unworthy ones as cato would not give leave in his company to have anything either good or ill said about them some will have the overthrow of carthage to have been one of his last acts of state when indeed scipio the younger did by his valour give it the last blow but the war chiefly by the counsel and advice of cato was undertaken on the following occasion cato was sent to the carthaginians and masinissa king of numidia who were at war with one another to know the cause of their difference he it seems had been a friend of the romans from the beginning and they too since they were conquered by scipio were of the roman confederacy having been shorn of their power by loss of territory and a heavy tax finding carthage not as the romans thought low and in an ill condition but well manned full of riches and all sorts of arms and ammunition and perceiving the carthaginians carry it high he conceived that it was not a time for the romans to adjust affairs between them and masinissa but rather that they themselves would fall into danger unless they should find means to check this rapid new growth of romes ancient irreconcilable enemy therefore returning quickly to rome he acquainted the senate that the former defeats and blows given to the carthaginians had not so much diminished their strength as it had abated their imprudence and folly that they were not become weaker but more experienced in war and did only skirmish with the numidians to exercise themselves the better to cope with the romans that the peace and league they had made was but a kind of suspension of war which awaited a fairer opportunity to break out again moreover they say that shaking his gown he took occasion to let drop some african figs before the senate and on their admiring the size and beauty of them he presently added that the place that bore them was but three days sail from rome nay he never after this gave his opinion but at the end he would be sure to come out with this sentence also carthage methinks ought utterly to be destroyed but publius scipio nasica would always declare his opinion to the contrary in these words it seems requisite to me that carthage should still stand for seeing his countrymen to be grown wanton and insolent and the people made by their prosperity obstinate and disobedient to the senate and drawing the whole city whither they would after them he would have had the fear of carthage to serve as a bit to hold the contumacy of the multitude and he looked upon the carthaginians as too weak to overcome the romans and too great to be despised by them on the other side it seemed a perilous thing to cato that a city which had been always great and was now grown sober and wise by reason of its former calamities should still lie as it were in wait for the follies and dangerous excesses of the overpowerful roman people so that he thought it the wisest course to have all outward dangers removed when they had so many inward ones among themselves thus cato they say stirred up the third and last war against the carthaginians but no sooner was the said war begun than he died prophesying of the person that should put an end to it who was then only a young man but being tribune in the army he in several fights gave proof of his courage and conduct the news of which being brought to catos ears at rome he thus expressed himself the only wise man of them all is he the others een as shadows flit and flee this prophecy scipio soon confirmed by his actions cato left no posterity except one son by his second wife who was named as we said cato salonius and a grandson by his eldest son who died cato salonius died when he was praetor but his son marcus was afterwards consul and he was grandfather of cato the philosopher who for virtue and renown was one of the most

[Verse 2]
Sever the limbs off my torso and burn what remains
Ayy, shouts out to Coheed
I would not be alive if I gave in to one of the times
That I wanted to be 6 feet deep beneath all of our feet, ayy

I found a reason to be in hopes you will deify me
I'm sick of writing, I would rather be in Andromeda
That way it would take a billion years for you to find me

Damn Love Song,pop,Kris Delmhorst,2001,203,{},"How can I carve your name in the trunk of a tree that'll be here long after we're gone?
I can't even write it in the steam on the mirror
And with nobody listening, not even myself, it's as much as I can do
To whisper those words in your ear

After all of these years, look at me here
With a love song stuck in my throat
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
I won't let it go

How can I dive right down in the deep blue sea and still hope to find my way home?
When I stumble on my way to the shore
And when all of the airplanes, all of the cars, and all the miles in the world
Are sometimes not enough to quite reach your door

After all of these years, will you look at me here
With this love song stuck in my throat
Got the weight of the world and there's not too much else I can hold

And what if my chances run out someday
What if life's not my batting machine?
What if it stops throwing pitches before I hit one clean?
How can I lie beside you night after night and pick at the lock on your heart?
When I never once opened my own
Cause the last time it got free, it just cut & run like a stray out in the street
And it took just about all I had just to make it come home

After all these years, is the time drawing near
When a love song flies from my throat?

Lay down the weight of the world and call myself home

Ruby Like a Jewel Live,pop,Patty Larkin,1990,3,{},"[Verse 1]
Her face is as long as a night that won't end
She watches time pass like she's seen everything
Her jacket is torn with brambles and thorns
Worn down at the sleeve
It's a little too large for her and her shoulders bend
But she can care less about such things as these
There's a radio on and it warms up the wind
Like the hand of a friend in the breeze

[Verse 2]
She sleeps on a grate behind Copley Place
Where the hеat is escaping from skyscraper space
And shе follows the news
From a paper that's used by some worker in there
She clips out the notices and pins them inside
Her salvation coat lying there beside her
Before it gets dark
She's gonna walk to the park
And listen to the music for free
[Chorus]
And it's only the will to survive
Only the look in her eye
That gets her by
Gets her by

[Verse 3]
She heads across town in no particular direction
Her face wears the look of a lack of expression
She's long given up her idea of perfection
In this life
She remembers a guy that she saw in the gutter
Crying out for a sister or a brother
He looked like her father
She felt like his mother
She wanted to be his wife

[Chorus]
Now she still hears the sound of goodbye
It makes her hold on to the sky
And it gets her by
Gets her by
Gets her by

[Verse 4]
Her face is as long as a night that won't end
She watches time pass like she's seen everything
Her jacket is torn with brambles and thorns
Worn down at the sleeve
Last time I saw her it was down by the river
I looked in my pocket to see what I could give her
She sat down for a while
Gave me a little smile
Looked straight ahead, then at me
[Chorus]
And it's just one more reason to cry
It's just one more reason to try
And it gets me by
Gets me by
Only the will to survive
Only a look in the eye

Hold Up,rap,Atlas_Raps,2018,8,{},"Knew I could do this cuz i'm who they call
Fake love is deadly they want you to fall

And all of you rookies don't fuck w the law
I smoke on the kush she don’t answer my call
I did what it took she don't care what I saw
Yuh

And i just been going thru changes a lot
They locked up my dawg when they raided the spot
I gotta go hard cause i'm all that he got
I'm dressed in goyard when I pull off the lot
The wars still to come all these battles I fought
I told em my trap is just getting too hot
We go back to yours and break down what we bought
Yuh

Feel like I don't wanna answer my phone
I know it's your girl she won't leave me alone
She blowing me up cuz she think that i'm home
But i’m back on tour I take one to the dome
She never was yours and I hope that it’s known
They pouring up 4's I feel right in my zone
The Christian Dior what I wear w the foams
Yuh
Telling my momma don’t worry i'm straight
The checks coming in and my bills never late
If cash what they send imma mail em the plate
Big racks what I spend for a house on the lake
No cap what I cop it come right from the bay
Big facts all i preach and it's all imma say
Face tats like i'm PeeP come for thrones like i’m Jay

Cuz I finally made it i'm tryna be wise
You must be mistaken i'm tryna get mines
I bring home the bacon with burgers and fries
I know that they faking i've heard all they lies
I'm just tryna make it I gotta be strong
A few of em naked I string em along
And bitch I feel perfect I never do wrong
If she like the Percocet gotta move on

Hate when i'm gone but she love when I leave
My chest feeling emptyvmy heart on my sleeve
I ride in the Bentley there's Rafs on my feet
Not feeling friendly I don't wanna meet
Did that by myself I ain't have me a team
I'm building my wealth all i had was a dream
I'm quick w the stealth I be quick w the scheme
Yuh
She keep on hitting my phone it's too late
I packed all my bags and i rode outta state
Don't know why they sleep cuz I aim to be great
You better cop now cuz i'm raising my rate
I bought a bust down and my mom a new wraith
I buy the whole pound just to cop me an eighth

I am no longer competing with these bitches, it's a mockery
Fuck a lane, we're not even in the same race
Couldn't quite put my fucking finger on what's stopping me
Then I lapped them so bad they think we in the same place
I've been moving
You don't want no friction like Newton
Shit about to snowball and it ain't gone stop
Y'all gone lose it
This is my court I'm well suited
Ain't no jury left hung
Bitch you taking that loss
Look, I've been doing me and I've been stacking up
Downplaying what I'm earning now I'm laughing up
Bank statements doing numbers, bitch, so now shut up
Watch the lil humble struggle rapper coming up
Cuz all these blogs got y'all broads gassed up
All y'all got no bars, y'all washed up
No Tide, no softener
My rhymes are hot stuff
Snow White just rocked up
Y'all lies and all cut

I been watching bitches come up off of shit that they ain't write themselves
Cuz they done sold what I still have but mine is not for sale
The game's a marathon, ya bitch, and only time will tell
Y'all cosign, fly by nights and then watch them fail
I've never been the type to be impressed with none this regular shit
I think the hype around a rapper is a hell of a trip
I think the eyes tell it all and it's so evident that I'm just so obliged to announced that this game is television
And all y'all fraudulent
That's why you broads in this, salty as condiments
You bothered that I'm back and all of it just like I thought it would
Cuz some of y'all went crazy and some of y'all fell off
Some of y'all ain't shit and some of y'all still fraud
I could've called it back when all these fucking labels got involved
I guess they thought I was like y'all fucking thirsty for a dollar
Fuck that!
Snow don't fall for no bullshit
I kept my publishing and sold Woke and the movement
Get no cut

You know what I'm saying I mess with lyricists, man. I got Snow Tha Product on the new album, man y'know, on a song called ""So Dope."" People want to see her, y'know, and I hope her label, I hope they put out her album, 'cause we put out our people. If I would've gotten at her the two years my partner, Travis was like ""You gotta  check out Snow"". I was like ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ok"". And I was so busy that I never did, and when I did, I was like ""Woah"" and it was too late

So still she don't move

You don't even know your truth
What you choose to see
(What you choose to see)
Think it's judged
By how you look
It's only skin deep

People change
And by no means I blame you
But the girl I knew
Would never do the things you do
Actions speak louder than words
Who's that girl?
She can't be heard

The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy Gentleman Chap. 4.58,misc,Laurence Sterne,1759,3,{},"       &nbspMy father had such a skirmishing, cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations, thrusting and ripping, and giving every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn—that if there were twenty people in company—in less than half an hour he was sure to have every one of 'em against him.

       &nbspWhat did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an ally, was, that if there was any one post more untenable than the rest, he would be sure to throw himself into it; and to do him justice, when he was once there, he would defend it so gallantly, that 'twould have been a concern, either to a brave man or a good-natured one, to have seen him driven out.

       &nbspYorick, for this reason, though he would often attack him—yet could never bear to do it with all his force.

       &nbspDoctor Slop's Virginity, in the close of the last chapter, had got him for once on the right side of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow up all the convents in Christendom about Slop's ears, when corporal Trim came into the parlour to inform my uncle Toby, that his thin scarlet breeches, in which the attack was to be made upon Mrs. Wadman, would not do; for that the taylor, in ripping them up, in order to turn them, had found they had been turn'd before—Then turn them again, brother, said my father, rapidly, for there will be many a turning of 'em yet before all's done in the affair—They are as rotten as dirt, said the corporal—Then by all means, said my father, bespeak a new pair, brother—for though I know, continued my father, turning himself to the company, that widow Wadman has been deeply in love with my brother Toby for many years, and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion, yet now that she has caught him—her fever will be pass'd its height—

       &nbsp—She has gained her point.

       &nbspIn this case, continued my father, which Plato, I am persuaded, never thought of—Love, you see, is not so much a Sentiment as a Situation, into which a man enters, as my brother Toby would do, into a corps—no matter whether he loves the service or no—being once in it—he acts as if he did; and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse.

       &nbspThe hypothesis, like the rest of my father's, was plausible enough, and my uncle Toby had but a single word to object to it—in which Trim stood ready to second him—but my father had not drawn his conclusion—

       &nbspFor this reason, continued my father (stating the case over again)—notwithstanding all the world knows, that Mrs. Wadman affects my brother Toby—and my brother Toby contrariwise affects Mrs. Wadman, and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night, yet will I answer for it, that this self-same tune will not be play'd this twelvemonth.

       &nbspWe have taken our measures badly, quoth my uncle Toby, looking up interrogatively in Trim's face.

       &nbspI would lay my Montero-cap, said Trim—Now Trim's Montero-cap, as I once told you, was his constant wager; and having furbish'd it up that very night, in order to go upon the attack—it made the odds look more considerable—I would lay, an' please your honour, my Montero-cap to a shilling—was it proper, continued Trim (making a bow), to offer a wager before your honours—

       &nbsp—There is nothing improper in it, said my father—'tis a mode of expression; for in saying thou would'st lay thy Montero-cap to a shilling—all thou meanest is this—that thou believest—
       &nbsp—Now, What do'st thou believe?

       &nbspThat widow Wadman, an' please your worship, cannot hold it out ten days—

       &nbspAnd whence, cried Slop, jeeringly, hast thou all this knowledge of woman, friend?

       &nbspBy falling in love with a popish clergy-woman; said Trim.

       &nbsp'Twas a Beguine, said my uncle Toby.

       &nbspDoctor Slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction; and my father taking that very crisis to fall in helter-skelter upon the whole order of Nuns and Beguines, a set of silly, fusty, baggages—Slop could not stand it—and my uncle Toby having some measures to take about his breeches—and Yorick about his fourth general division—in order for their several attacks next day—the company broke up: and my father being left alone, and having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that and bed-time; he called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote my uncle Toby the following letter of instructions:

       &nbspMy dear brother Toby,

       &nbspWhat I am going to say to thee is upon the nature of women, and of love-making to them; and perhaps it is as well for thee—tho' not so well for me—that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head, and that I am able to write it to thee.

       &nbspHad it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots—and thou no sufferer by the knowledge, I had been well content that thou should'st have dipp'd the pen this moment into the ink, instead of myself; but that not being the case—Mrs. Shandy being now close beside me, preparing for bed—I have thrown together without order, and just as they have come into my mind, such hints and documents as I deem may be of use to thee; intending, in this, to give thee a token of my love; not doubting, my dear Toby, of the manner in which it will be accepted.

       &nbspIn the first place, with regard to all which concerns religion in the affair—though I perceive from a glow in my cheek, that I blush as I begin to speak to thee upon the subject, as well knowing, notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy, how few of its offices thou neglectest—yet I would remind thee of one (during the continuance of thy courtship) in a particular manner, which I would not have omitted; and that is, never to go forth upon the enterprize, whether it be in the morning or the afternoon, without first recommending thyself to the protection of Almighty God, that he may defend thee from the evil one.

       &nbspShave the whole top of thy crown clean once at least every four or five days, but oftner if convenient; lest in taking off thy wig before her, thro' absence of mind, she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by Time—how much by Trim.

       &nbsp—'Twere better to keep ideas of baldness out of her fancy.

       &nbspAlways carry it in thy mind, and act upon it as a sure maxim, Toby—
       &nbsp'That women are timid:' And 'tis well they are—else there would be no dealing with them.

       &nbspLet not thy breeches be too tight, or hang too loose about thy thighs, like the trunk-hose of our ancestors.

       &nbsp—A just medium prevents all conclusions.

       &nbspWhatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to utter it in a low soft tone of voice. Silence, and whatever approaches it, weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain: For this cause, if thou canst help it, never throw down the tongs and poker.

       &nbspAvoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her, and do whatever lies in thy power at the same time, to keep her from all books and writings which tend thereto: there are some devotional tracts, which if thou canst entice her to read over—it will be well: but suffer her not to look into Rabelais, or Scarron, or Don Quixote—

       &nbsp—They are all books which excite laughter; and thou knowest, dear Toby, that there is no passion so serious as lust.

       &nbspStick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt, before thou enterest her parlour.

       &nbspAnd if thou art permitted to sit upon the same sopha with her, and she gives thee occasion to lay thy hand upon hers—beware of taking it—thou canst not lay thy hand on hers, but she will feel the temper of thine. Leave that and as many other things as thou canst, quite undetermined; by so doing, thou wilt have her curiosity on thy side; and if she is not conquered by that, and thy Asse continues still kicking, which there is great reason to suppose—Thou must begin, with first losing a few ounces of blood below the ears, according to the practice of the ancient Scythians, who cured the most intemperate fits of the appetite by that means.

       &nbspAvicenna, after this, is for having the part anointed with the syrup of hellebore, using proper evacuations and purges—and I believe rightly. But thou must eat little or no goat's flesh, nor red deer—nor even foal's flesh by any means; and carefully abstain—that is, as much as thou canst, from peacocks, cranes, coots, didappers, and water-hens—

       &nbspAs for thy drink—I need not tell thee, it must be the infusion of Vervain and the herb Hanea, of which Aelian relates such effects—but if thy stomach palls with it—discontinue it from time to time, taking cucumbers, melons, purslane, water-lillies, woodbine, and lettice, in the stead of them.

       &nbspThere is nothing further for thee, which occurs to me at present—

       &nbsp—Unless the breaking out of a fresh war—So wishing every thing, dear Toby, for best,

       &nbspI rest thy affectionate brother,

without an ally was that if there was any one post more untenable than the rest he would be sure to throw himself into it and to do him justice when he was once there he would defend it so gallantly

Dimebag,rock,Blaze Bayley,2012,269,{},"I feel a diamond shine
Somewhere in my mind
When I hear the sound shine

The 8th of December in 2004
The wicked tragedy and horror that would shock us all
The was a diamond shining
Shining so bright out there
A bright and shining star of Texas shining everywhere

We are broken now
We are broken down

Silent insane and evil
Thoughts stolen from his mind
Now he has come to destroy Dimebag
Where he plays and shines
The Alrosa Villa, Columbus, Ohio
Damageplan are rocking out doing their metal show

We are broken now
We are broken down
Though you died
You will always be alive here in me
Though you died
You will always be alive here in me

Though you died
Though you died
Though you died

Up to the stage he's walking
The gun is in his hand
He starts shooting and won't stop until he's taken down
From behind the madman
A single shotgun blast
Ends the madness but the horror of that night still lasts

Dimebag is shot four times
And three more lost their lives
And seven wounded by evil
In that twisted mind
Fifteen shots are fired
Thirty five to go
The courage and the carnage
Of that night in Ohio

We are broken now
We are broken down
Though you died
You will always be alive here in me
Though you died
You will always be alive here in me

Though you died
You will always be alive here in me

Love Needs a Fool,pop,Chris LeDoux,1994,77,{},"[Verse 1]
She lives for the thunder, he lives for the rain
She was born in Manhattan, he grew up near Spokane
He found her sittin' by the side of the road
Her long hair shining like that black Texas gold
They had nothing in common 'cept the need to move on
So they headed for someone further along

[Verse 2]
Dust devils were spinning out across the fields
That bridge was a burning underneath their wheels
That ol' muddy river was just a running wild
For that Western boy and a sweet Yankee child
She was more of a woman than any girl he ever knew
He had no idea what his world was coming to

[Chorus]
Love needs a fool
How 'bout you
Well, how 'bout you
Love needs a fool
How 'bout you girl
[Verse 3]
Ol' white picket fences by the side of the road
Hanging on broken hinges, too weak to take the load
Just like that old farm boy when he wrapped her in his arms
He knew he'd never hold her long enough to tame that young girl's heart
But he loved her with a fever that went way across the line
By the time that the sun was high she was holding on through the tears she cried

[Chorus]
Love needs a fool
How 'bout you
How 'bout you
Love needs a fool
How 'bout you, babe

[Outro]
You gotta be fool enough to believe in love
If you want love to believe in you

LISTEN TO THEIR SCREAMZ

[Verse 1] (A-Game)
I'll take a.... meat cleaver and stick it in your dome
And keep hackin away with a grin on my face until your head implodes
I propose that I take a knife and commence to slice you slowly
Listen up homie, cause I ain't no fuckin phony
I'm fresh out the mental ward after 10 years with an evil grin
Now I'm having visions of carving my name into your skin
To leave my mark and prove a point your life is mine
Hell, I'll even show up later at the scene of the crime
The doctors told me to make sure to take my meds
But I sold em, and now paranoia runs through my head
I'm so grotesque, I only write lyrics at witching hour
To release the demons in my head and let me all scour
On the pen to the pad, now I'm feeling insane
What were they thinking letting me go? I cannot be tamed
As I approach a civilian, several thoughts run through my mind
Can I calm down and drop the knife, or is he gonna die?

I pulled the clip out and put in 10 more rounds
Now I, got the gun pointed at your mom in the kitchen
She started bitchin, so I had to kill the bitch and
Not to mention, killed your brother and your sister
They got into my business, and I don't like snitches
You should've heard the screams, you should've seen the blood
Then I drug your whole family through the mud
Towards the holes that were dug into the ground
No one came around, therefore they were never found
Fuck it, I'm only here to say one thing

Twizzy got a girl but yet he probably got a second ho

Chop it up and make it raw something like a vegetable
And I'm dominant, guarantee I promise it
And I'm feeling confident that I could run the continent
And when it comes, I'll be ready like I never have

Swallow Me Whole,rock,I Saw Daylight,2017,88,{},"There is so much that is wrong
But I keep answering „I´m fine“
I am hiding behind words
I keep smiling though I´d rather die
It´s in my head and I try to make the best of it
But I feel dead when I put my hands on my chest, no beat
I have forgotten how to come alive
I will never live again
There is so much in this world
That I have tried to leave behind
Things that you have never heard of
I could tell the truth, I´d rather lie
It´s on my tongue and I try to swallow everything
At the bottom of a well, is where I find myself today
Drag me to the deep, lights above me
Something I will never reach
At the bottom of a well
Is where I will always stay
All alone, drown me to sleep, swallow me whole
Everything continues to function
But will it last for a lifetime
Is this what I want or what I wanted once
But never believed in
There is so much that I´ve learned
But I keep following the dark

Go!, Go!, Go! Go!

[Verse 2: Mir]
Hey
Bitch, I'm the one
No introduction needed
So tell them fake pussy's at the top
That they can beat it
While y'all would relax
I would practice cause I need it
Now we can't even spell L's
Undefeated
Rappers packing heat
But I'd much rather tourch'em
Now we killing baby rappers
Knee deep in abortions
I'm tryna blow up
Live my dream with a couple of dollars
Give the team Gucci with a couple of Pradas
More fish in the sea, is like a bunch of piranhas
Even niggas I grew up with, barely holla
Cause rappers think that they hot
But they not
Word to my shoelaces
And I be damned if I stop before I'm everybodys favorite
And to the niggas I came up with
I'll call if I make it

[Verse 3: Jay Wills]
Ok
Rule 23
Every Jordan needs a Pippen
My stance in rap just changed
Like a ball players pivot
I could never stop no read lights in my district
My parents strict on me
Cut this shit , circumcision
I got deep in the game
Just from this little incision
And my flow just right
Like the little bears porridge
I'm making runs
You call it long
I call that shit Forrest
My pockets on green
Like camera when they record
Bitches show me a good time
Like I'm the chorus
As a rapper I still go
I ain't reach my flourish
Rapping on some other shit
Like I ain't flush the toilet
Do the shit and leave the bowl
That's why your ass stink
We Come with the boom just like Nike
And most bitches say they like me

Perfect shawty,rap,Lone Arti,2021,10,{},"(INTRODUCTION)

She said that she has a boyfriend
I think he doesn't know
That behind your back you are acting like a whore

(CHORUS)

Her interest is gaining momentum
She tries not to catch my eye
She asks my friends to tell about me
I got many different arts
She says
She need another part
Fighting with some demons
Start another round
Satan is watching me
He is the main boss
This girl drank a couple of shots
I have to drink more
She asked where my diamonds
I told her that I would fuck her without them
I’ll do it without
Shawty fall in love

This man says
That he will catch up with me with bullets
But he never held a choppa in his hands
He says that he can fuck this shawty

I enter this bitch
Like I’ve never been here
She pretends
She doesn't know what I mean
Trust me
I know how you feel
When I took his girlfriend away
He said know who you are have dealing with
I chose you among hundreds of bitches
Now tell me
How would you spend all your time with me
Tell me about all this romantic shit
I’ll try to forget my pockets with greens
She likes the way the greens rustle
Forget all the shit that happened before
I'm confused
Because sometimes I can't explain this shit
(TRANSITION)

Love this girl
You can be my world
If you stay with me
I can do whatever you want

30 Minute Love Affair,pop,Paloma Faith,2012,2282,{},"[Chorus]
30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

[Verse 1]
The city lead me out one night
Through lonely streets and neon light searching again
I met a stranger singing songs
Sat in that doorway I belonged with him, just talking

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He was so beautiful there in my dreams
I left my heart and my memories
[Chorus]
30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

[Verse 2]
He told me he'd be there tomorrow
I knew where he led I would follow
I flew and he knew
When I went back he had disappeared
My hopeful smile had turned to tears
Let down, no sight nor sound

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sometimes it's better just to let them go
Cause your illusion's more than what you could know

[Chorus]
30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair
[Bridge]
Falling from the sky for him, I'll never regret it
He took my breath away
And although it was the shortest time
I'll never forget it
He gave me such a beautiful lie
Oh, my

[Verse]
Oh la di
I get it in like Bomani
I done gone Bobby
And built me a bank
Can’t nobody
Embody Bonnie
I’m 'bout it, 'bout it
I body the whole lobby
And I don’t need a ghostwriter
My mind on fire like Ghost Rider’s
And if I go ghost, that’s more fire
On deck, like roast pirates
I cook up, release, book up, shook up
Stage
Look up release, pull up, pull up
Pay
Know the quality is guaranteed
All I do is cook up what I need
Luckily we got a common de-
Nominator, serving to the safe
Know I gotta keep it safe
Though I’ll never let it lead me stray
Same time, keep a sane mind
Sane mind keep a safe mine
Mine mine, keep it safe
People take, I ain’t ever seen a sane mime
I ain’t ever been Jemima’d
I ain’t ever made sweet
I ain’t ever been tamed
And I ain’t afraid to let you see the teeth
[Chorus]
Flowers in the snow
All is just to grow
If ya didn't know
Ya can't say you don't (anymore)

[Verse]
Oh la di
I get it in like teaspoons
All with a grin that'll tease poon
I get the skins like teepees
But too many friends in the teepee
And too many chins on the tiki
Will put you in hot water like tea leaves
But ain't no space in the tea bowl
If you don't wanna get T-Boned
Put up, release, pull up, hook up
Ways
Took up what we coulda put to
Gains
Highest quality ain't guaranteed
If I never cook up what I need
I just got addicted to the sweets
Used to only get a bitter taste
Used to only chase for the chase
I ain't ever make it past the chase
Whole-time, what my time fo
A fine foe is a Typhoon
I done flown into Typhoons
So much I'm a finephobe
Oh it's priceless to focus
Ain't no progress that's free
Depending on how you frame it
Ain't no friend like defeat
[Chorus]
Flowers in the snow

Can't forget the heat, I'm bringin' it
Baghdad bully
Man I'll rise that fully
Then I'll link one goodie

Come and take this woody
Call me daddy, then I might get happy
And I grab your batty
Call me Mally
Then I might get tappy
And I back my sammy

Back this rambo knife, have man lookin' all saucy, a lie
And pussy-o's hear that bang

Blacked out fully when we do ride
Stepped on your block, nobody in sight

Baby-girl, you remember when we
Were buying hotels, laying in the bed with me
Thinking this forever, you would laugh with me
Really, that was heaven and it never left me

Ever since we went to games, with the smiles ready
Every time I pick you up the nerves were deadly
Now it's like it never works, when you being sexy

Smoked for the first time
Wonder how this shit'll go, when it passed time
Thinkin' this'll be the worst or the best time
Ended up being the start of our best lives

Ass fat, didn't matter if you ran more
Parents in the other room, while we binge watch
And I tore that ass up in the same spot
[Bridge]
Pussy better than this type beat
Stay pullin' on her hair till she ride me
You the one, if I forget, then remind me
You the one, if I forget, then remind me

[Chorus]
Now we better just as friends
Better than the road it led
Pray I'm not the reason you bled
Pray you not the reason I left

[Verse 5]
You conflicted, then it's better just to say sum
(Say sum)
If I'm angry then you'll know ill just say sum
(Say sum)
You playin', then ill go ahead play sum
If they givin' me a chart, ill place 'em

[Verse 6]
Always had a dream of goin' overseas
Love, you MVP
I can make it happen if you come with me
Love, you what makes me
This shit goes deep
You remind me
You remind me
You remind me
[Verse 7]
Most popular girl that I went to school through
Was amazed at the people you help and talked to
But friends never were your friends unless you helped too
That attention left you in your bedroom
Colored lights with the red from the dark blue
Tryna live another life, but its too soon
Or not another, but none and that would work too
That's before came in, and then I met you

[Chorus]
Now we better just as friends
Better than the road it led
Pray I'm not the reason you bled
Pray you not the reason I left

Do Not Disturb Remix,rap,Angel Rodriguez,2019,42,{},"I put my music on pause, when I really should've left it on as go
But lately expressing myself verbally, worries me, cause it just doesn’t come together
Sounding good like how its supposed to be, like how it was back then when I had everything really going for me
But really who am I to blame?
I said I wouldn't give up on music this year but nothing really changed
And its sad to admit that I feel split apart
Going different directions, when I feel like I should be stuck in park. Now really what do you suppose or expect me to do?
That's why confronting myself right now feels like the best thing to do
So I hope this sets aside everything I wanna get through
Cause now I’m in this game and there ain't no room for acting clued
I'm lyrically ready for any challenge in my way
So before you start making accusations you should really know your place
I've been talking so much like if is was some type of debate
And I'm still running up my numbers, like if we were running a race
I give credit to yall niggas yall really know how to make a song
But can yall really vent on this type of beat?
Hmmm nah not at all
There's no way to go on about it without telling the truth
Most of the time I would keep it to myself, but that's something I can't do
I’ve been pushing myself to a mark that nobody can reach
So whenever you hear my lyrics just know that there’s only one of me
I must've sounded so cocky, but man I’m so fucking unique, ever beat I get I promise ima kill it and put it to defeat
Man
I swear lately I've been in my zone
My phone on do not disturb, cause lately I need my space alone
So if you ain't in my inner circle you better run along
Cause now I got my crew and there ain't no way I’m going back alone

Westside Romance,pop,Ellijah,2019,148,{},"[Verse 1]
I move so effortless
Your kisses leave me breathless
The breeze takes my pain away
I couldn't see when we were on that train
Telling stories while you heard my regrets
We had air but you were still so tense
I didn't see what was so crystal clear
I was looking through eleven cracked mirrors

[Verse 2]
You move like you are a wreck
Tears of anger pressing against your chest
My name was tarnished but you didn't care
A forest fire but you stood right there
You told me things that made me smirk
I told you things that didn't work
Now all we can do is reminisce and laugh
Threw out the mirror that made it all black

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there done that
Breakups that reloaded
Heart warms that burned me
All the way to the third degree
Your love letters are soothing
A magenta with Saturn's blue rings
You say I'm oh so moving I love that I do that to you
[Chorus]
We were on the six train St. Lawrence street
When you dropped the news on me
I stayed up all night
Then said yes and started our paradise
Is this a daydream someone pinch me
A westside romance at thirteen with you
And it's all right cause your beautiful

[Verse 3]
My head is in a cloud
Thinking of you never puts me down
I know we'll never go out of style
Your demeanor could over see the dark around
It's a fairytale night
I'm singing in my crescendo
Even in the brightest of daylights
I see different shades of purple

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there done that
Breakups that reloaded

Loving you is sweeter than ever,pop,Susan Tedeschi,2005,362,{},"Paroles de la chanson Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever :
I remember yet before we met
That every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely woman

I remember meeting you
Discovering love can be so true
When it's shared by two instead of one

When you said you love me (when you said you love me)

We could not be parted (we could not be parted)
And I built my world around you (I built my world
Around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

And loving you is sweeter than ever
(I ain't never felt like this before)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, sweeter
Than ever
Each night I pray we'd never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger
From day to day

As best I can, and how I try
To reassure and satisfy
'cause I'd be lost if you went away

'cause I really need you (really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too

(if you don't go breaking my heart)
I have built my world around you
(I have built my world around you)
Baby I'm so thankful that I've found you

And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Before
(I ain't never felt like this before)
And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
So much sweeter

That's what loving you (loving you)

'cause I really love (really really love you)
And I'm thankful that you love me too
(thankful that you love me too)
I have built my world around you
(I have built my world around you)
I am truly glad, I am truly glad
That loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(you don't know how much this means to me)
When I'm loving you
Me, you, us
Sweeter than ever (tell me about it)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(you don't know how much this means to me)
I'm loving you, you made my life sweeter than ever

It Seems That Things Just Cycle,rock,Randall Kirk Jones,2018,28,{},"I read to think of death as a punctuation
And before the sentence ends find something worth saying
But how could I capture this life on a page
It took me my whole life up until the last couple days
To see the best thing to do is let some things just go unexplained

And I've read about the rise and fall of civilizations
How we can't see if they're rising or deteriorating
Until the collapse is within times grasp
Knocking even the most powerful
People of the past down to
Long since forgotten facts
Collapsed ruins
And museum artifacts

But the sum of all my thoughts don't begin to make a dent
No amount of microscopic scrutiny will make this all make sense
I'm fixated
Downward spiraling
On where this whole thing's headed
Some days seem like perfection
Others, end all Armageddon
Dear God every question is just a branching path of dead ends
Is this place in disrepair
As everyday I do nothing but watch from my chair
And I've read some novels but not in a while
My attention spans receding to that of a childs
Seeing mountains of text only remembering the headline
Til misinformation is passed around like cheap wine
That stains our teeth one sip at a time

Don't you remember love?
First time you melted in my arms
We were young and on the run

My love is calling
You're just ignoring
It feels like we done lost our sting

Don't turn off the lights when
I've been in here trying
Are we just too broken, my dear?

Money to Blow,rap,Konan Doyle,2020,16,{},"Ever since I started rapping I acted like I was so big I had somewhere to go
Now I’m here packing my crap in a case as I wait for the word on a couple of shows
Only one project, a prospect. I’m already seen as a munchkin who’s hungry to grow
Everyone flexing online, I’ll remind you that I do not need any money to blow

You’re riding a wave
While I got hundreds of flows that could fuck up your boat
You’re lying in vain
Talking ‘bout fucking these hoes while they chucking they dough
What you’re trying to say
Glorifies something we know leads to mumbling dopes
I mean, why don’t you play
Music with stuff we can show to the public to grow (ah)

I’ve heard of kids that be dying for nothing but a pair of shoes (ooh)
I want the music that won’t lead to creating more perished youth (ooh)
I want to stop them from falling - I’ll do my best to be your parachute (ooh)
Even though I have those days I’m in bed and can barely move

Move
Out of my way
Sorry, but how do I say this, you’re crowding my lane
I got mountains of patience and sound to escape from the hourly wages, I’m ‘bout to embrace all the mountains and ranges
I’ll bounce on a stage and I’ll shout what my name is
Surrounded by fakes in the town I was raised in
So now I can’t wait to get famous, I’d say that explains it
I only work with authentic people
Made a corporation out of ink
These featherweights rap if they see quills
With my pen, I’ll be first on the screen

Rappers depend on the refills
So they get their support from the lean
Maybe they’ll balance it out with a
Cane
Wait.. that’s not what I mean

Listen to me, won’t you stick to the green?
Because it’s gonna lead to more victims if we keep on singing ’bout lean like it gives us relief, I mean spitters could be working diligently on the image we leave with the children who need it and if we succeed then these kids can be free from the shitty emcees. (Shitty emcees?)
Literally


Ever since I started rapping I acted like i was so big I had somewhere to go
Now I’m here packing my crap in a case as I wait for the word on a couple of shows
Only one project, a prospect. I’m already seen as a munchkin who’s hungry to grow
Everyone flexing online, I’ll remind you that I do not need any money to blow

I don’t want to spend a hundred grand
To go and get the upper hand
I’d rather save a couple bands and try to pick up all the fans by making stuff they understand instead of suckin up a Xan, fam

I don’t want to toss a bunch of dough, I’m gonna optimize the flow by writing songs, doing shows. I’ma obviously blow, I ain’t popping but I know that I ain’t got nowhere to go when rock bottom’s all I know, woah
Is that too deep?
It’s just my 2 cents, ya man’s too cheap
People bite on the hands who feed
While I stand to fight on my damn two feet
See my plan’s to write til fans increase
So I have to light up these whack emcees
Now I know it so wrong, the flow is so strong, it might be like when ya Tampax leaks

Period
You know, for emphasis

Seriously, I am known for penmanship
Hero to be, but my own biggest nemesis
Fighting my demons like I am the exorcist

Agh

Cooking these birds like a butterball
If I don’t like a person then I cut ‘em off
I won't buy a verse, so I’m uninvolved
I ain’t fucking with these hot girl summer songs

I’ll always be
Trying to see why they idolize people who lie through their teeth
I always preach saying I’m only me. Every rhyme that I speak is like writing a speech

I don't have tell you I'm real 
That I cum for Sun Hill 
Everybody know the deal 
Disrespect me, feel the steel 
Near me fear is what they feel
Can't destroy nothing I build 
When I go, I go for kill 
You can tell easily, I'm ill 
Believe me, your blood gon' spill 
Make a few steps back and chill 
Go relax or take a pill
Y'all dudes be salty like dill
I'm popping pills like I'm Bill
Grab on her titties, I feel
I'll hang you by window sill
Independent like I'm Will
I got this locked like Meek Mill
Your girl be ugly like Jill
I told y'all I am for real
You said you big, boy, big deal
I keep on making big bills
Boy, are you tryna get killed?
Boy, mess with me, you're next kill!
Yah, yuh yuh
I still live for the night
Have to see the light
But I live for the night
Tryna get on that flight
And my stuff be so tight
Got loudpacks, that is no lie
Imma get there, why wouldn't I try?
I want to get rich before I die
Gotta get that money why only know I

Up all damn night, can't seem to get this off my mind
Don’t like to say this, but this life it’s killing me today
A little drink to keep me satisfied, a little weed to keep me high and low
Stop and think before you compromise the very life you inside had hoped to own

Pre-Chorus:
And I thought I could fly
I thought I’d seen the light
But my days are getting darker
And it’s getting even harder to hold on tight

But I can’t stop, I’m sticking strong
I won’t shut up, Till you hear these thoughts
To the good ole days in Tennessee
And slightly remembering what it was like when I needed to belong

Sleep all damn day, I guess it’s my turn to pay
Don’t like to say it, but my lifе I was wasting away
A little soberness I need for me to get over this, it seems to be my fault
But with my open mind and closed heart, I’m growing fine a fresh start that’s all

Cause one day I’ll fly
I know I’ll reach the light
Cause my days are getting brighter
And I’m holding even tighter I’m alright

And how I finally know that I don’t need to belong

I just wanna know if you really still love me
I don’t wanna stand around lookin like a dummy
Everybody see you putting nighas way above me
Gettin all these vibes that you don’t even think of me
Cutting off our ties so you don’t have to be ‘round me
I know that’s part of griefing but yo actions so outstanding
I think yo heart is freezing, interactions are abandoned
You over here just seeking, claiming I’m the only bandit

Hoping you not another hater then (Hoping you not)
Really thought that we could be friends (I really thought)

Now I might be getting jealous
Cause a nigha hardly reckless
I remember you were precious
Now-our relation just a relic
Cause I’m feeling no more presence
I just want you just to listen, all them nighas just some lessons
But you go on with yo living, I’ll still pray for you, all blessings
Gonna miss our lil sessions
Already miss our first impressions
Already miss all your expressions
Remember back when we were freshman, building that connection
Then wanted more than to just be friends, hoping that the text sends

I really want the past back, put the hammer to the nail

Think it's a Poison, But spreads like a disease
But I think it's annoying
Buy annoyance to Employing
Plotting art for the explosion
Drawing pictures visualizing
That my art was capitalized
Never had eyes but to the rise
I'm a visionary
Picture perfect hitting all the lights
Its explanatory
Walking down looking at the mic's
Cause she talks like a florist
Greenest grass
Thinking of a girl that had some class
And the cash shes exploiting
But all I wanna do is import
My importance
Not deport my remorses
But I'm just exploring
Taking totes like its a garden
Passing papers through my yard
And I'm flicking my regards
To the guards that's deporting
I'm ordered to bypass all the scars thats recorded
Fast foward it
But rewing to the day I was exploited
The creepers creep all on me but the girls they would Rearm it

Let it hit for a second
Thinking bout all my lyrics as I pray to all the reverends
I am opposed to all the chemist
My chemistry to nature is against my adolescence

But she is begging for my presence
I'm a dark ass person but i bless her with my essence
The nigga that she's been with in the past destroyed her presence
But I enlighten all of her spirits I am her present

Talkin' bout money and stacks but I say fuck it
I'm speaking for the niggas with some class all in there guts
And if you see me? pray and say thanks that a real nigga
Stands in the path of your stance
You never seen me? take a glance
And think about how masculine i am with just a mask
The holy grail has spoken but I proceed
To light and burn the potion

Washington, D.C., September 11, 1861

MAJOR-GENERAL JOHN C. FREMONT.
SIR:-Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d instant, is just received. Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing your proclamation of August 30 I perceived no general objection to it. The particular clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves appeared to me to be objectionable in its nonconformity to the act of Congress passed the 6th of last August upon the same subjects; and hence I wrote you, expressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly. Your answer, just received, expresses the preference on your part that I should make an open order for the modification, which I very cheerfully do. It is therefore ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed as to conform to, and not to transcend, the provisions on the same subject contained in the act of Congress entitled ""An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,"" approved August 6, 1861, and that said act be published at length with this order.

The Abyss,rock,Phoenix Nebula,2018,3,{},"THE ABYSS

I was looking inside
In the abyss
And it was looking
Inside me

We are searching a light
We all feed our void
Again, and never
Enough

And now
We all are here
Picking up the dust
And somewhere
I know you're like me

My eyes
Are still bleeding
Without a faith
An hope
A future or you
I felt the void
I couldn’t stop, no
I couldn't stop
Never, never

The abyss was everywhere
Cold embrace
Hands that can
Only hurt
Voices that
Can only consume
Every wall
Has fallen
*scream* *uh*

Those who fall
Those who wait
Those who embrace an abyss
That seems too empty
The abyss that I need…

Those who cry
Out the flesh
Those who want
To succeed
Filling the emptiness
The abyss that they need…
We are forced to find
The right place to die
‘cause we couldn’t live
Without pleasant lies

John John Da Don vs Pat Stay,rap,Don't Flop,2016,515,"{""Don\\'t Flop"",""John John Da Don"",""Pat Stay""}","[Round 1: Pat Stay]
John John Da Don
What's your puppies name? Jean Claude The Dog?
Pat Stay, I tell these cats straight, you got the most mix matched face
Chipmunk cheeks, monkey ears and a bat face
Hate his guts, be like, ""Look at that?"" Bang
Neck chop, head drop, lady had a bad day
You think cause I'm from Canada we don't clap thangs
Man, my chick bust shells like a hatched egg
Just cause we in Atlanta, don't try to Brave
I kick up dust like Chipper Jones in his last game
Man, I don't like your whole energy
Get too close next to me
Hennessy, popped at his head like an old memory
No thought, robot, battery sold separately
Now he got his Head I.C.E. , I Control Everything
Look, I'm old school like tear aways
The beef ain't done but I see blood like a rare steak, let it marinate
Ignorant, I see a bum sleeping, jack his spare change
And step on his head like a high top stair fade
Bitch, I'm the wrong one
Yo, he ain't strapped, if he lifts his shirt, his glasses fogged up
Black on black crime, yo look in the brown eyes of this shotgun
I wish this brother would/wood I'd turn his ass into saw dust
Aww shucks, aww shucks, aww snap, the god's back
All black, smoke shades, gold chain with the claw clasp
[?] ball cap with some contrast, all that
Fox on my nuts like a review of my ballsack
Aww snap
Y'all done brought back the wrong Pat
That raw rap, punches through the roof like Mortal Kombat
Watch me outdo you
If John scraps, as soon as I see John hand cock (Hancock) that's the sign to give him all caps
Aww snap
Let me take these frames off
James Bond, 007, let's get this game on
You see me look at my watch, I'm not checking the time
Cross enemy lines then boom this proximity's mine
Till your face gets split out wide
I'll drop Johnny On The Spot if we take this shit outside
Oh I know a couple grimy landscapers looking for work
So if John dare (Deere) test me they'll peel the sawed (sod) off and put in the dirt
But what are you gonna say to me?
Make me look like a racist or try to steal the crowd away from me
Yeah? I knew it!
That's what I thought, that's what you gotta do
Exaggerate all the struggles of pain in your life
That I could never understand or can't relate cause I'm white
Like, ""Yeah white boy, what you know about being poor
And all you got to eat is gun?""
Listen here fucking freckle face
Arthur The Aardvark looking sucker
Big ass nerdy fucking bifocals, suck a dick fucking bitch
You ain't got these folks fooled, you white as snow dude
His idea of soul food is tofu
And don't even try that gangsta shit with me
It's not you dude, Honey Boo Boo in FUBU it doesn't suit you
260 pounds hard body, fuck a deuce deuce
I could probably pick up a bullet and chuck it right fucking through you
Dawg, this a one round body like Bruce Bruce
I said, John John Da Don
Bet that story is so interesting
Must've patented that name instantly
I remember vividly how sad I was when I seen that ""Pat Pat The Don"" is copy written, jeesh
Now go ahead and spit your garbage, start screaming cause that's all you do
Wrote this shit in 24 hours and still bodied you
What's up?!
[Round 1: John John Da Don]
Now I knew me taking a race angle may be predictable
But what else am I supposed to talk about with these fucked up conditions that we living through?
It's in the news, cops killing black people like it's the thing to do
But when the white boys shoots up a black church, the same cops gon' bring him food
You've seen it too
Don't be looking like, ""I'm Canadian eh, what you want me to do?""
Well since you here, make it clear you don't condone the shit your people do
Now let me guess, you're from another country right? I got the wrong guy?
Well I hate to break it to you white boy, but you came to the wrong place at the wrong time
We just lost an ATL legend, you don't gotta know...they know
But since I can't speak to the dead, ring on his head, that's my way of saying hello (halo)
I have shottas on the east, but they say he's from the west side
Well goddamn-
Hold on, set it off, like Stoney and watch every bitch in your crew die
Cause we pulled up with cans for you bums, now that's a food drive
I call a goon squad, tell 'em to sweep the whole room, that's a boom job
Better yet, put something in his bitch chest, make it a boob job
I know, I know, gun bars can be redundant
But I find it funny, I'm the gun king
Nigga I'm a king that got a line of guns
I'm sorry Rone
You sorry we can set that up after this
But for now it Pat turn, nity (paternity) test I show you who your daddy is
Just so you know I bet somebody half my pay
And from the looks of things I should be getting some extra cash today
Ain't you Irish?
No?
I was hoping some kind of luck get passed your way
But it's me that's seeing the green everywhere, this ain't Patrick's Day
But that's okay, cause you just stepped in my backyard, I'm comfortable
I don't even gotta try to act hard, but don't try that card
And say we bias like don't nobody rap with them
Cause I'ma let a .44 go behind him, now he got a cult (Colt) following
You got your fans fooled, you not a star you just a gassed bitch
So if you win you got them swayed see
I know your tactics
No reactions?
Don't worry, it's a good thing, y'all ain't catch it
I said, ""Star, you went Swayze"" that let's me know y'all ain't falling for none of Pat's tricks (Patrick)
Glasses, which one of you shiny motherfuckers said that shit?
My last shit?
Was a dog walk in the park, y'all see me bag shit
And you just lost to Serius Jones, the guy who Matt hit
And it was caught on TV so he may judge your honor if I show Math this (Mathis)
I'm active
50 different cities, 30 different leagues
That chain made you the King Of The Dot slave, you ain't get to leave
He said watching DNA and Charlie Clips go off the top is his biggest peeve
That's how I know you racist, cause you just hate seeing niggas free
I get it G's, you looking like you wanna say, ""nigga please""
To say what you think we say as if you fitting in ease
But now that you been exposed for all your bullshit nigga schemes
I feel these people hate you more than Meek for what he did to Beans
Hollow, Calicoe, even Serius got him
But a hollow from this Calico will give you serious problems
So don't be surprised if he lose cause he never win
Funny how that compliment battle did vers' Rone was the nicest you ever been
You really did a compliment battle?
What in the holy fuck
So you had to come up with clever shit to make your opponent blush?
One minute you the Sucka Free Boss all swoll' and tough
Next minute you calling another man handsome more than Loaded Luxx
We know what's up
Cause you already dead it's just a time relapse
My mind went black and all you heard was bllllllllllllah!, like a Desiigner track
Ten shots, one in the stomach, guess where the other nine was at?
Pat head like a bitch with a weave she ain't trying to [?]
Be honest Pat, you feel out of place in this stage don't you?
You'll call the cops if I punch you in your face, won't you?
So save all that bully shit the birds I'll fuck you up with these glasses on call it Revenge Of The Nerds
This niggas a herb and there's no way he could fight
Could give a fuck how tall he is I'm still taking him light
But please don't say ""The John"" if you ain't saying it twice
Cause if you don't add ""Da Don"" you ain't saying it right",2889630,en,en,en,john john da don whats your puppies name jean claude the dog pat stay i tell these cats straight you got the most mix

Modern Warfare,rap,Dan Bull,2012,5255,{},"[Verse 1]
This is for my cousin Alex
Yeah
Yo, I'm John ""Soap"" MacTavish
Done loads of damage with my gun
Blown up baddies
And then totally vanished
So keep your eyes peeled
And your lips tight sealed
Or you might feel
The might of my riot sheild
Forget Battlefield
And feck the Batmobile
You might as well be playing blackjack
Or Track & Field
Dragon slaying's aggrivating
And it lacks appeal
Button bashing
Cutting, slashing
Nothing that is real
I've got the knack to wield
A plethora of weapons
Level up again
Collect the set
And come for seconds
I'll kick your RSASS with an MP7
Then I'll kick your arse
(ass)
Send you to the heavens
Yes, I'm quite divine with a Type 95
Ha!
I bet you couldn't even type ""95""
I'm not pulling your leg
I'm putting you to bed
With a bullet in your head
So goodbye, nighty night :)
[Verse 2]
Ayo I'm dropping tons of songs
In Cluster bombs
A Tuff Gong
So If I'm not your #1
Then there's something wrong
Suck your mom
I've done a ton of run and gun
You've done a runner, son
I run amok amongst these other
Motherfucking chumps
I'm a son of a gun
You're the son of your mum
There's not another that's as good
Under the sun
I'm
More than the sum of my parts
Pull you apart for fun
I'll serve a server full of nerds
As I'm the hardest one
Between you and me
I'm a UMP
You're a pea shooter
Doing stupid to a T
I'm sure Yuri can do a free beautifully
And Captain Price's tracks are nice
But they lack the
Fanatical
Tactical
Flashy
Grammatical
Radical
Classical
Stats
To satisfy my appetite
If any prat'll mess with me
Then he dies
So blast this MP3
Like an MP5
[Verse 3]
You don't need a statistician
To see I smack the rhythm
With a degree of accuracy
That's needed for atom splitting
That's precision
When I'm rapping about matter, fission
Having a laugh with physics
And still bringing cracking lyrics
To challenge MacTavish to a battle
Is a bad decision
Masochism
I'll kick your ass on any map you pick
And have you wishing that you didn't
Little lad, you lack the jism
To come back and tackle Britain
And in fact this is an actual acquisition
Of Activision's rap division
And Daniel's mission
Is to kick the ass of competition
I'm a handy mix of Andy McNab and Biggie
And when I smoke a fag
I don't mean that I have a ciggie
Sorry for the homophobic slang
But that's what happens
Idiots'll thrown a frag
And blow up faster
Than my rapping videos
Although I love kittens
I'm a great softie

Counting Days,rap,Max Nordau,2017,28,{Friz},"(Intro) ‪
One day. (Monday)
Two days. (Tuesday)
Three days. 
Four days. 
Five days. (Friday)

Max Nordau: (Verse 1) ‪
Yea, been thinking bout this shit
And you know me
I'm always drinking bout it
This bitch got me fucked up. 
She knows watsup. 
That's fucked up!
I'm fucking giving up on this shit
On shit
Weed and dreams are my two prescriptions. 
I'm a victim to depression
But I ain't depressed for shit
I'm a villian
Waiting for a chance to win
Where's my happy ending? 
My beginning never said
So I guess I'm dead
To the world
A menace to the people
But when I see you?
My presence becomes someone
Which is sentenced to see through, 
Visions.  ‪
I've read this book, 
And it took me ages
Stages of stories. 
Levels of education
But now I know what I'm facing. 
It's no worry
Getting an evaluation, 
By my peers
I'm peer pressured
I'll like to reassure my schedule
I'm available when she's able, 
To give me time. 
If she ain't giving up money for the cable, 
Looks like we just looking at a blank screen. 
A tv with no satellite. 
I guess we just chilling. 
She just might start digging, 
Inside my mind
Looks like I'm alright. 
I'm fine. 
FRIZ: (Hook) ‪
One day. (Monday)
Two days. (Tuesday)
Three days. 
Four days. 
Five days. (Friday)
Wednesday
I've spent a day for Thursday
It's the first rate for my weekend. 
The first date and she freakin'
You know when she receiving
Money she spend
Now she leaving. 

Max Nordau: (Verse 2) ‪
Looks like I need an escort
Through my tunnel of life
But I'm an expert when it comes to my mind
Cz my heart doesn't know how to feel
So it shines a lightbulb
Oh look how bright that is?
That's it!
I'm right where I need to be
I just hold on tight
Cause this rides a remedy. 
A night in these empty streets, 
Empty me. 
I like how you kept me at my feet
I just might simply beep
If you're in my way
It's a one way travel
So unravel your words
And grab on to what you've heard. 
Cause your ""acting"" only works, 
On an audience
Which is great. 
I'm applauding this
Now you got a bitch to claim, 
A pitch to play
(You're insane!)
Which is the same, 
As the rest
Which means, 
You ain't putting your best. 
At it. 
Music is my fluid
I inject the drug. 
I'm an addict
Now I experiment, 
And now you're in my experience. 
Hearing this. 
Feeling shit
But you ain't fearing this
Which means I'm a failure
Again I'm hurt
By my own words
But I'm putting in work
To push in my slurs. 
And move joy out of my life. 
Trying to avoid
This shit in my mind
Which is, 
The pursuit of
Happiness
Which I purchase for
Valuable things
(Hook) ‪

Max Nordau: (Verse 3)
Yea, she just left me. 
Fucked up. 
She put the best in me, 
Pills such as ecstasy
Filled me with these drugs, 
To feel happy. (LSD)
The worst feeling is no feelings
You experiment my experience. 
I say you experimenting, 
On your own experience. 
Your soul experiences experiments
You're getting old. 
You glow with gold
You've grown cold. 
And your story unfolds. 
You should panic, 
For taking acid. 
But I'm calm
Til I fall in
Acid
And burn my tonsils. 
I can not sing this song. 
So I've decided, 
To hit this bong
I'm gone

Baby, you stole my line
The way that you said, ""Wanna get out of here?""
You hopped up and said, ""Just drive""
You knew a spot where the sky stays clear
And that sundress strap on your shoulder's fallin' down
Yeah, you sure got me figured out

[Chorus]
I'm a sucker for small towns, roads we can ride down
Gettin' all lost on a Saturday night
I'm a fool for a full moon, you sure set the right mood
Findin' that country on the dashboard dial
Oh, if you were tryin' to get me to lean on in for a kiss
You knew just what to do
I'm a sucker for small town nights like this with a girl like you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you sure got me good
Right where it looks like you want me to be
Out on this old truck hood
In the middle of Two Lane Town, Tennessee
And if you're tryna trick me into fallin' hard
Oh, it's lookin' good so far

I'm a sucker for small towns, roads we can ride down
Gettin' all lost on a Saturday night

I for One Welcome Our Robot Overlords,rap,Richie Branson,2017,2740,{},"[Verse 1]
Look, my intelligence is far from artificial
I swear to god my mental's sharper than an artist's pencil
Or the sharpest Ginsu
I got raw potential
Every song I make is classic like Atari systems
Not the type of guy succeeding at sports
Everquest Online, I was swinging a sword
I used to tell the ladies, ""Hi, I'm just keeping it short
I want to put my Cat5 in your ethernet port."" (eh heh)
Yeah, that will get you slapped in the face
I was just a tad late at attracting a mate
Yeah, I never would have thought that I'd be rapping on stage
I'm making music every day people actually play
I mean, in rap years, I think I'm kind of old
But I perfected my delivery like domino's
It's still a shock to see that people think my rhymes are dope
I'm not talking lines of coke, I'm talking lines of code

[Chorus]
I, for one, welcome our robot overlords
I, for one, welcome our robot overlords
I said I, for one, welcome our robot overlords
Don't want to see us go to war, so welcome our robot overlords
[Verse 2]
I'm too cold, I got liquid cooled entrails
I'm just trying to get my chip sucked, call me Intel
Uploaded to the cloud like a chemtrail
Weaving through these bars like T-1000 in jail
Overclocked when I spit in the booth
I gotta keep it hot enough to play on infinite loop
I got software in everything in my room
I even got a smart bed so my sleep is the truth
Slept on like they hitting the sheets
I started from the underground, now I'm living the dream
Seems like I learned a lot from the digital screens
Enough to turn calculators into sentient beings
I'm so debonair
I got a handsome stare
Rappers say I'm not good enough, so I can't compare
I'm still a gangster, I just rob them with the ransomware
Plus I probably pirated more bytes than a rabid bear

[Chorus]
I, for one, welcome our robot overlords
I, for one, welcome our robot overlords
I said I, for one, welcome our robot overlords

Karma Comes Back Around,rap,Adam F,2001,646,"{Guru,""Carl Thomas""}","[Intro: Guru]
Hahaha Adam F on the track
Speak Guru representing
Yeah! Carl Thomas
Everybody wants to be somebody you know
Just be yourself man, stop trying to be like everybody else
Frontin' like you got this and got that
Yeah it's not about the material things
They don't rule my world, do they rule yours?
Well I feel sorry for you done, but for real
There's a lot of grimy cats out there that will wyle out on you
That's why you gotta stay on point
Be aware of what's goin' on and hold it down, from us to you

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
As your world goes up and down (oh yeah!)
The karma comes back around (comes back around yeah!)
Don't you know that your gettin' what you put in the ground
(Don't you know that your gettin' what you puttin' in the ground)
Just be good to yourself 'cause you know that you always have to come down
[Verse 1: Guru]
Everybody wants the baller life
Everybody wants a fly car, nice crib and all that ice
When they see me in the street, they wanna call the vice
Get on some landlord shit and turn out all the lights
I'm like the toll that you should've paid
You said you had the Mac, why you should of sprayed!
What happened to the chicks and the chips you bragged about?
What happened to the guns and the clips you bragged about?
I heard about they stomped you, and beat you, and dragged you out
You said they heard they got me, and that I doubt!
Street smarts and most y'all punks you need heart
My peoples get busy for real soon as the beef starts
Wanna learn some more about me
You're sure to see that I'm a stand up guy
With maturity and during this speech I'm always willin' reach
I love my peeps that are still in the streets

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
As your world goes up and down (As your world goes up and down)
The karma comes back around (Don't you know that the karma comes on back around)
Don't you know that you gettin' what you put in the ground
(Don't you know that gettin' what you puttin' in the ground)
Just be good to yourself 'cause you know that you always have to come down

[Verse 2: Guru]
Everybody wants the wealth and fame
But nobody wants to hustle and the struggle
Just to earn themselves a name, it's like they want it all instantly
And since I know what really goes on son I think differently
I always to try to keep my fam' tight even if we don't hang out no more
You're still my man aight, see money changes many things
You go from just gettin' by to shopping sprees buying everything
The guard came up hard straight out the boulevard
I pull your card, get in your skin like a bullet scar
I'm holding the weight controlling your fate
'Cause you didn't play the game by the rules you know it's too late
You tried to hop the fence on false pretence that's nonsense

[Verse 3: Guru]
Everybody wants to be the boss
Everybody wants the spotlight but don't wanna pay the cost
Me, I give a kid direction if he says he's lost
Some suckers want attention, that's why they love to floss
But me I don't care about that there
You say you're from the hood, you can't go back there
The same folks you see coming up, you'll see going down
Take that look off your face, you know what's going down
We about to strip you of your stripes you little ass wipe
About to take over your spot uh huh that's right!

Gettin' took for your goodies for no apparent reason
And during this speech I'm willin' to reach
All of my peeps that are still in the streets

Are You Ready,country,Amber DeLaCruz,2018,145,{},"[Intro]
Umm hmm, umm hmm

[Verse 1]
He's got a southern charm and his deep blue eyes start glowin' when the moon gets high
No tellin' who he came with but it's about that time that his pasture be crossin' my mind
Well the night was gettin' younger and the heat of that summer and I knew that he could feel it too
When he started gettin' closer put his arm around my shoulder and he whispered in my ear

[Chorus]
Are you ready to get a little buck wild
And crazy girl I got just what you need
To cover something little into me
Baby let me take care of that, you can be my friend check
Tip it on back now, I'll show you around town
Around the backwoods when you get lost give up your good
Just come on in buckle up if you're ready for a good time
'Cause it's gonna be one of those nights

[Verse 2]
Got lost on some back roads, dropped into four low, down to the little biker creek
Janglin' our bare feet, turnin' up that country beat, like up in the pine trees
Gettin' nothin' but up in the bed of his truck, had me wrapped there in the palm of his hand
Sayin' baby, this ain't the end of the night and it's one you're gonna remember for the rest of your life

Are you ready to get a little buck wild

'Cause it's gonna be one of those nights
Oh it's gonna get crazy tonight

Yeah we drove to the sentry mart, just before he put it park I turned to him and said boy, I ain't had enough
So are you ready boy, ooh ooh yeah, oh yeah

Its Over,pop,Andy Williams,1970,20,{},"If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over

When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over
So I turn my back
And turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all
I set my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
It's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay

Echo,pop,Maroon 5,2021,14357,{​blackbear},"[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
You lit the neon inside of my chest
There was no vacancy
I felt the flick of the light that she left
You left a space in me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Novocaine
I thought I couldn't feel no pain
But it still feels like, ooh, when I hear your name
I can't escape, tryin' but I can't escape
(Let me go)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)

I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)

You flipped the beat 'round inside of my chest
Changin' the frequency
You had me trippin' the night that you left
Lost electricity

[Verse 3: blackbear]
Yeah, I got this heart-shaped hole inside of me
I try to fill with anything
Like taking trips and buying things
Burn bridges that once guided me
And I hate the way I watched you leave
My ego got the best of me
I gave you insecurities, these tears fall on my Bentley seats
And now all I feel is depressed, all that I taste is regret
I cannot tell what is real, only the pain that I feel
You give me nothing but stress and this echo (Echo, echo, echo)
You left in my chest

I Dont Know Where Im Bound,country,Johnny Cash,2000,1136,{},"""I have to sit down for - okay, we'll do that for you, just a minute, thank you. This young man here at San Quentin tonight that wrote a song that I just saw written down on paper the first time yesterday. He sent me the sheet music on it, and I don't know anybody who reads music, except maybe Helen. And I liked the lyrics so much I started singing my own tune to it, you know, the first thing that came to my mind. Let's try a little bit of it, right here...""

I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
Whistle's calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound

Can't stand locks, bars or doors
Mean cops, insanity, and wars
Gotta find a place of peace
Until then, my traveling won't cease
But I don't know where I'm bound

There's got to be a place for me
Under some green growing tree
Clear cool water running by
An unfettered view of the sky
But I don't know where I'm bound

When I die, don't bury me
'Cause then I must be free
Cremate my body with a grin
Throw my ashes to the wind
'Cause I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
Whistle's calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound

Got myself a little gal
She has been a downright pal
That old highway's calling me
And free I got to be

TAGS,rap,richard. (Rapper),2015,27,"{""​richard. (Rapper)""}","[Verse 1]
Never assembling
Scratching out your dividends
Showing off my tags
So you know I'm foreign to giving in
Come play with the wolves
I dare you to step inside this den
Seen lambs get torn apart in the dark
And thank you for stopping in

Roll with water moccasins, standing our ground until the death
27 strikes to your neck before you can take breath
Beating on my chest and my vest is made out of battle scars
A mercenary, never wanted the life of a lavish star

[Verse 2]
Really in reality sometimes I want to show my tags
See people think I'm weak
'Til they see defeat on my darkest rags

Built me into this
Still my fist is clinched when I take the pain
If I could fight it physically
Then I'm thinking some things would change
Show my fangs and breathe a flame in the ocean
Some people say they don't want drama
But they hang with commotion
I'm Komodo with no motion
My power comes from The Chosen
Leggetit

[Chorus]
If you ask
Yeah, sometimes I like to show my tags x8

[Verse 3]
Making promises you never keep
Might as well never say it
Never play it cool
I act a fool until your moods degraded

I don't have to be the greatest
Graded on how bad I slay it
Play it like it's still unrated
Faded to blacker than ravens

[Verse 4]
Go back inside your cage
You crave the darkness
And you ravage
But hazardous havoc is on this path
If you don't go back to it
I'm asking nicely stop trying to fight me
Before I split our psyche
[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
I know where my strength is at
I'll run it 'til my ankles crack
Never leaving you so get used to it
You can't take me back

Quit the act
You know you're not dedicated
We'll never be separated
Medicated on thoughts of being levitated

[Verse 6]
Time to decline
You'll never get the chance to ruin me
Stay out of my mind
When will you ever stop pursuing me?

Is it considered battery if I attack the bad in me?
Straight to the Master's feet
And I'm scratching this wolf mentality

Smoke you like a peace pipe
Hey you could say goodnight
Okay alright, dynamite!
So burn mothafucka
Burn mothafucka, burn!
Now when will you learn
Doorknob, its my turn
Yo don't try to get this or even try to sweat this
Check this I'm all about the wreckers
Got the trunk full of cuetes

[Capitol I-Man - Verse 2:]
Let me kick my rude manners
From here to Alabama
Not a (?) From Atlanta
Never cute like a panda
But check the way I wreck it
The way you never could expеct it
Props get collected in full Tha funky Mеxakinz
Oh why, oh why, oh why
I gotta be the way I am
You know your jealousy don't bother me
So I don't give a damn

Lookin in the sky it's bird or a plane
That'll be your final thoughts
Before I blow out your brain!

[Mr. Sinful One - Verse 4:]
Tell me why, why
It doesn't seem like I'll be going nowhere
That's what my mom said
What makes you think I care?
The ghetto!
Is where I'm from and where I come from
It's no fun unless you shoot a fucking gunl
Run, from the fucking pigs is what we don't do
Shoot'em up, shoot'em up
Before they fuck you
I'm down to go head up with a mothafucking pig
Drop the badge and the Barretta
And let's see who shirt'll turn redder

No me quiero a mismo como voy a quererte a ti
Abran las puertas, cabrones ya llego
Por el que lloraban gritaban sin saber lo que esperaban


[Capitol I-Man - Verse 6:]
Should I, or should I not
Would I, Or would I not
But if I could I would so don't go slippin in my hood
Because I'm misunderstood now you're telling me I'm no good

Running Gun,country,Michael Martin Murphey,2016,134,{},"[Verse 1]
I rode out of Kansas City heading south to Mexico
I was running dodging danger, left the girl that I loved so
Far behind lay Kansas City and the past that I had earned
Twenty notches on my six gun marked the lessons I had learned

[Verse 2]
Many times I sold my fast gun for a place to lay my head
Till the nights began to haunt me by the men that I lay dead
Couldn't stand it any longer with this life that I'd begun
So I said good-bye to Jeannie and became a running gun

[Verse 3]
I rode into Amarillo as the sun sank in the west
My thoughts in Kansas City and the girl that I love best
As I smiled and kissed her gently and then turned away to go
Said I'd send for her to meet me when I reached old Mexico

[Verse 4]
I had barely left the saddle and my foot just touched the ground
When a cold voice from the shadows told me not to turn around
Said he new about my fast gun knew the price paid by the law
Challenged by a bounty hunter I turned around to draw
[Verse 5]
I knew someday I'd meet him for his hand like lightning flashed
My own gun stayed in leather as his bullet tore it's path
As my strength was slowly fading, I could see him walk away
And I knew that where I lie today, he too must lie some day

[Verse 6]
Now my strength is slowly fading and my eyes are growing dim
And my thoughts return to Jeannie
And the home that we had planned
Oh please tell her won't you mister
That she's still the only one
But a woman's love is waisted when she loves a running gun

Like the leaves they thought would stay
Making every child think
That they might be back one day

When the horse had escaped
The innocence was gone
This heart will never be the same

Lady Susan Chap. 32,misc,Jane Austen,1871,4,{},"Mrs. JOHNSON To Lady SUSAN

Edward Street.

        My dear Creature,—I am in agonies, and know not what to do. Mr. De Courcy arrived just when he should not. Mrs. Mainwaring had that instant entered the house, and forced herself into her guardian's presence, though I did not know a syllable of it till afterwards, for I was out when both she and Reginald came, or I should have sent him away at all events; but she was shut up with Mr. Johnson, while he waited in the drawing-room for me. She arrived yesterday in pursuit of her husband, but perhaps you know this already from himself. She came to this house to entreat my husband's interference, and before I could be aware of it, everything that you could wish to be concealed was known to him, and unluckily she had wormed out of Mainwaring's servant that he had visited you every day since your being in town, and had just watched him to your door herself! What could I do! Facts are such horrid things! All is by this time known to De Courcy, who is now alone with Mr. Johnson. Do not accuse me; indeed, it was impossible to prevent it. Mr. Johnson has for some time suspected De Courcy of intending to marry you, and would speak with him alone as soon as he knew him to be in the house.

Go fuck yourself
Fix the lipstick on your mouth
Before you come into my house and...
Go fuck yourself
If it helps to see it clearer
Yeah, you can use a mirror...
To fuck yourself
Yeah, I smell it on your blouse

You should try to be a bit more secretive
This isn’t how two people live
You take and take, I try to give
You’re always on that negative
Well, I don’t see no positive
We live in that zero
Next time you leave the house
Just keep your cell phone near you
I don’t wanna talk about it
I don’t need to take this
I’m a free spirit and you know that I’m spontaneous
Why you always tie me down?
You must be delirious
You think I’m fucking all your friends?
Nat, you can’t be serious!
[Chorus 2]
I can taste it on your tongue
You’ve been sleeping with someone so...
Go fuck yourself
You go out behind my back
Like I don’t know where you’re at...
So go fuck yourself
I bet you gave a hummer
In the backseat of his Hummer...
So go fuck yourself
I can taste it on your tongue
You’ve been sleeping with someone so...
Go fuck yourself

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I only trust your friends
Just as far as I can throw ‘em
Actually, fuck your friends
I don’t even know ‘em
When grown men are texting you
Saying that you owe them
Can you really put the blame on me when I follow where you go, then?
I don’t wanna talk about it
Why you think I’m shady?
I go out on the town ‘cause I’m a high-class lady
Why you try to lock me in?
You know you’re not my husband
This house is like a prison
Sean, you must be buggin’

Come swinging chins no Kimmy G

Don't fuck with me
Troubled mind at the dawn of night

Just run and hide if you don't
Then you're the blood to my knife
And like a winger, bitch
I'll cut inside
Shit, it don't bother me
There's no soul in me
Bitch, don't bother me

Pussies necks
Bun cess just to fuck his head
Fuck his head, just to fuck his head
Just to fuck his head

Now rasta - dread is on me
Under Cvsper's melancholy
Fucking ground that cess and roll it
Falling faster in this dog shit

And this hopelessness, resentfulness
Repressing lust to end this fuck
In Tech's we bust, defenseless cunts
Get wet up like your dentures cos I'll

Take off your jaw
I'm insane I want more
Man, I'll take off your door
Put the blade to your mum's neck

For sure bust that 9 off
Fuck your life, dog

Let's go again, are you hearing us?
Mic check, mic check yo turn him up
I'm the epicenter of dirty stuff
Experimenting with thirty drugs

Woah, woah. Let's begin
Got that pole to your next of kin
Now watch him poke that metal in
Like Donald, bro I'll press it in

You pussy bitches anger me
Don't fuck with me, I'll back the ting
You ugly, fuck with fat bitches
You're nothing, bruv but Cvsper is

I'm liable
To Michael 'em, slice 'em
Go psycho
Alive in the night, go

To sleep in the day
Believe you're my prey
I'll feed as you decay
You're in my freezer for later

You're sick
Sick...
You wanna see sick?

Sick fuck, sick fuck
Hate myself, my wrist's cut
I don't really feel you
I just wanna kill you

And deep inside my face
You see pain, you see blood lust
Feel like I'm insane
'cause I'm blazed off that good stuff

And deep inside my soul is black
I might cock the gat
Deep inside I'm holding back
From psychotic acts

Cvsper speaks and you blast the speakers
Cvsper's feeding you masterpieces
Tracks are leaving the man there speechless
Mastered the craft of rapping he's a

Savage, Cvsp be
The sickest in the rap scene
And bitches wanna shag me
'cause his shit fucking slap, G

You could even copy my songs
And still somehow suck
Bitch I am convinced I'm a god
I faceplant, drugs

Filling up the whole of my body
Think I'm dead here
But wake up in the morning feeling horrid
With a dead chick

How am I alive? I can't die
I'm a demon - I'm not alive
Just a poltergiest, holding knives
Pop that 9 between my eyes

And I'm not bleeding, what's the deal here?
Got no soul - it's sold to demons
Empty these clips onto people

I swear that I can fly
(Fly far away from here)
I think it’s time to move
(Go anywhere but there)
If tomorrow is (?)
(Promise I’ll be by your side)
We’ll make it out alive
(Yeah, we’ll make it out alive)
I swear that I can fly

Verse 1:
Trapped in a cave with my own emotions
Been here for days, the way that things are goin’
I just keep thinkin’ about my past
Man it hurts so fuckin’ bad, let me out please
Can anyone hear my shouts?
My thoughts are barely breathin’
While my heart still steady pounds
The pressure of pleasures whatever measures
For better or worse, been up all night drinking
And thinking it’s just a family curse
It’s gotta be, I keep on tellin’ myself
Because there’s no one I can talk to since my pops lost his health
He’s so strong, nothing is wrong, he won’t make it
So I place him in God’s hands, funny I’m the one shakin’
God damn, I don’t understand, was this the plan?
Everyone I love got cancer, OD’in or in the band
Stickin’ somethin’ to coke, snortin’ somethin’ to roll
The problem starts here at home, no focus, no self-control
Gotta get up, back on my shit up
Maybe do some sit-ups, fuck these hiccups
Then nothin’ gon’ break us
Just know that, money ain’t everything
Got a piece of mind you can’t understand
You gotta pop out, hop in that motherfucker and shout out
Moore Music in the building, all you chumps can kindly bow out
Hop out, just sit in a circle and watch my wile out
No Nick Cannon homie, this drum line will eat your heart out

Verse 2:
All the will for livin’ is all gone
Everyone that you admired so much were all wrong
They taught you all these lessons
You would never second guess them
Now you’re looking in the mirror like
“Where the fuck did I go wrong?”
It’s on, grab a bottle and drink away all the pain
I’m forced to wear a smile, I’m prayin’ God let it rain
I hope these people understand me
They’re my fucking saving grace
I owe them for everything, I won’t settle for second place
The race is over, could say I’m lookin’ for closure
That is like findin’ a four leaf clover in a bed of cobras
Overexposure still wouldn’t do me justice, no one above us
The sky’s too wide to wait in line for other people’s grudges
Just trust me, yeah, get your feet wet
The reject, the neglect, what seems next
I respect yall reflex, fall down then bounce back
Don’t care what he/she says , my shit’s whack
Got no stacks, I climb charts, don’t need stacks
(?), played the fool dropped out of school
Like I don’t really need that, lookin’ back it’s stupid
Why the hell I do that? All I thought about was music
This industry I’ll influence, promise I’m gonna prove it
Lose myself in the moment, murder a beat for breakfast
And bury rapper’s personas, my principle is perspective

At Last the Forgetting or Look Mother Margaret its New Orleans Again,misc,Dave Wright,2014,119,{},"When I look for you in time
I condense all I know into a day
When I forget of April 14th
I forget of history, New Orleans, orphans and you
I forget all life happens on a sinking ship
I saw Mr. Lincoln going down
Inside the Titanic’s theater
And Mr. Booth is already on deck
Fighting The Yemassee War near the bow
Scenes of colonial enslavement &
Iceberg slaughter on the high seas
The steerage class flees to the outnumbered rafts
Like Apalachee refugees to St. Augustine’s knees
You and Noah Webster consult two Benjamins
Before adding ‘abolition’ to his new word book schemes
Early in the morning I see Stout Marshall Stoudenmire
Pull twin Colt Revolvers from his sides, gun down
Four vaqueros’s dreams aboard space shuttle Columbia (OV-102)
Having just returned to El Paso after its 37th orbit
When I look for you, Mother Margaret, it seems
Horus as the first orphan, raised by sister’s womb-stream
A Sycamore Tree named Isis, You, the three killings of Osiris
The bastard pharaoh of our dead brother Set rings
On April 14th I only see through The Eye of Horus:
For us I forget the 105th day in a leap year
I forget The Donner Party is just leaving Springfield
I forget ‘The Ballad of Tom Joad’ plays on the Zenith Short Wave
I forget I sing along in the middle of that Black Sunday Storm
I forget on April 14th, 1882, months before you died, you gave birth
I forget the boy’s name is Moritz Schlick: “Cat-gut Cord” Aran’s line!
& I forget Lebensweisheit is your posthumous eulogy
I forget that day in 1860, I carried news west for The Pony Express
The St. Joseph’s Gazette carried news of birth in Butcher’s Hollow
The Coal Miner’s Daughter turned 3 and gave her Bible to Von Daniken
I forget in ’41 that Peter Rose was born an orphan with King Leopold…
And they don’t allow orphans in the halls of Cooperstown or the Congo
So I forget you nurture Zamenhoff’s child-language after death
I forget the Allied Forces land in Normandy
I forget Robert E. Lee resigns from the Union Army
I forget Pocahontas marries John Rolfe, plays hungry games with us
I forget Ms. Tubman starts an Underground Railroad
I forget Mr. Koresh finishes the Bhagavad Gita & agrees to surrender
I forget and I forget and I forget, I forget I see it all, so stop:

Yea we gotta make money mehn (yea)

Why you gotta take somebody life in order to make money
Why you gotta make somebody mad in order to be poppin
Why you gotta be so wicked in your ways my nigga
Why you gotta sell your soul for the change my nigga

[Verse 1]
Take a girl pant, do a ritual make a lotta cheese
All you ritualist people get served with your piece
Nigga please, work hard stop taking girl pants
Lazy mothafuckah prefer shortcuts to work plans
Yea i know most ritualists are lazy
They don't wanna work so they use shortcuts it's crazy,(crazy mehn)
But Using shortcuts will shortcut your life
Everything rushed would not last alright?
You gotta follow the process, and you see the progress
Aim at solving problems, and you'll see the profit
We are blessed and cursed and the curse is work
But when we work, things work, we got cheese in our purse
Fuck rituals, fuck selling souls
Fuck stealing destinies fuck evil modes
Rather be broke than to kill somebody to make doe
Rather be broke than to sell my soul to make doe
Rather be broke than to steal pant to make doe
Rather be broke, rather be broke
[Verse 2]
Yo, the devil makes rich and adds a lotta sorrow
Every fucking thing gotten from the devil is borrowed, (whaat?)
God makes rich and adds no sorrow
Everything gotten from the Lord is Yours
Life is not a game stop playing with it mehn
Life is not a movie pause for a minute mehn
Life is not rehearsals we already in it mehn
Life's a bitch like karma you best be living well
Cause what you sow today, you will reap yea (yea)
The fruits of your labor won't be cheap yea (won't be cheap yea!)
Everything you do today come back some day
Why I pray, God forgive me for my bad old ways
Ok, no way will I follow your way
'cause your way the wrong way
It's not Yahweh, role play
I'm O.J and you O.K
You follow the folly way
I follow the Godly way
I keep rising, and you just keep falling in Aye!  (ayy!)
To all the ritualist girls
Listen, don't call me bae
Severing every relationship ever been between me and evil men
It's never been, gotta get with better men
I need peppermint to cool myself down
I'm better Mehn, send all my old friends to Neverland
In Neverland we ""Never""! Met
We was never friends, I flew up and Never Land
Holy Ghost in my system controlling my sentiments
Jesus be the Center man, God be the Central man
If you got spirit eyes you'll see I've been heaven sent (heaven sent)

You don't gotta take somebody life in order to make money

After the Apocalypse,rock,Aloan,2018,55,{},"[Verse 1: Lyn M]
Open my eyes the day after the apocalypse
I had expected something better from the apocalypse
Noon and still the same boredom, it's the apocalypse
Still no ideals and no thrill, it sleazy, sleazy, sleazy, sleazy, sleazy…

[Chorus: Lyn M]
Ochre dawn has come
Winter's feather's glum
There's no explosion, no fire, no judgment day
There's still some human robots in a line who sway
Ochre dawn has come
Our lives go and on

[Verse 2: MC Granite & Lyn M]
Open my eyes on the very morning after the apocalypse
Expected fire, chaos or solar eclipse on the apocalypse
And then you call me on my cellphone and you let me know you're OK with the apocalypse
Well if my end is by your side, then the ride is really worth it on the apocalypse

So in confusion end appears as an illusion
The world can stop just as long as we're in fusion when my

Common imagination through time across the nations
I still believe that you and I have reached a new dimension
I still feel my emotions go up and down and in all directions
You are my inspiration, my love my living mission

So tell my the world that they lied, our love is still hard
And we were not expecting the apocalypse to be quiet
So hold my hand 'cause at the end when we stop moving
We can keep our love in movement, nothing will slow our self-improvement

[Chorus: Lyn M & MC Granite]
Ochre dawn has come
Winter's feather's glum

Yo I'm curious, is this really serious
Or do we need an end to not fall into deliriousness
Feeding ourselves with answers that are making no sense
Well, every age with its stories, tales and mystical quests
That's just how we put all our fears and doubts to rest

Capo,pop,Awiii,2021,1,{Exiz},"This another chance that I won’t waste
Another chance your lips that I could taste
Singing our songs of love again
Promise you this melody won’t ever end
Cuz our love blend so right
Gonna embrace your body more so tight
Felicity is what you bring to me
Ooh baby do you hear our symphony?

This is so perfect I know
No more letting you go

Strum the strings that attached us together
Make a sound that will not die ever
Not adjusting pitch for it is just right
We need no capo, our key is fine
Thrum it up and down still it’s okay
The voice of your heart makes my day
Not adjusting pitch for it is just right
We need no capo, our key is fine
No no wе need need no
No no we need no capo
No no we need need no
We need no capo

This anothеr journey we will take
Bearing all the mem’ries that we’ve made
Laughing at those things that we’ve cried for
And crying at each shoulder when we crave more
Cuz 24 hours a day is not enough
Hearing your voice that pampers me when times get rough
Serenity is what you bring to me
Ooh baby baby when I hear you sing to me

This is so perfect I know
No more letting you go

Strum the strings that attached us together
Make a sound that will not die ever
Not adjusting pitch for it is just right
We need no capo, our key is fine
Thrum it up and down still it’s okay
The voice of your heart makes my day
Not adjusting pitch for it is just right
We need no capo, our key is fine
This new score that we are trying to create
We sing it like a vow and I promise you
To never cease this music that we have
Smoothly it’ll run from our mouths
That is why we need no capo

Strum the strings that attached us together
Make a sound that will not die ever
Not adjusting pitch for it is just right
We need no capo, our key is fine
Thrum it up and down still it’s okay
The voice of your heart makes my day

Never Enough Remix. PT2 Bonus,rap,OfficialKidJj,2021,18,"{SonicAj,""Dante Gomezz""}","[Lyrics from Snippet]

It's not fair, I'm better
I treat you with respect and then I write a letter
You don't care, I'm stupid
You don't listen , You think that I am useless

It's Never Enough
Time's like these get tough
I can't even get a hug
That's why you are so sus
I thought you were the one, it was only for fun
Maybe it's me though
I don't agree though
Say that you want me
Started feeling lucky
2 weeks later
Turns out I'm the dummy
I can't even lie tho
Got me on a tight rope
Wanna hold on but it's not worth my time tho
I guess it's alright
All we do is fight
No pressure
But I got girls in line
Not tryna call
Gotta catch my next flight
Hope I see you one day
Smiling on a beach day
Thanks for all the laughs
But it's time I go my way
See you on a run
Don't waste no time
Guess we are done
It's not fair, I'm better
I treat you with respect and then I write a letter
You don't care, I'm stupid
You don't listen , You think that I am useless

I am so sad, why are you mad
I ain't do nothing, you are just blushing
I'ma play football, I'm in a dark hall
This is a remix, I'm just a genuis
This was just us, I'ma go cry and just take a bus
All you do is cry, I'ma look up at the dark blue sky

It's Never Enough, I'll put you in a handcuff
I'm sorry for what I said, Please don't ever leave me on read
I just want forgiveness, I got a witness
I am so sorry, open up Safari
Type KidJj
And listen to this remix

Women without a man is nothing
Women... without her, man is nothing

Yin and yang, yeah you see the challenge

Women have their faults
Men have only two
Everything they say and everything they do

Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage
They've experienced pain
And have bought jewelry
Women have two weapons
Cosmetics and tears

I'm a perfect housekeeper
Every time I leave a man I keep his house
No woman has ever hated a man
Enough to give him back his diamonds

They don't have time

A girl can wait for the right man to come along
But it doesn't stop her from having fun with all the wrong ones in the mean time

The real reason why it's so difficult to find men who are sensitive, caring and good looking?
Is because they all have boyfriends already

I'm a bandcamp singer songwriter
And my album covers, are pictures of nothing with vintage filters
And there's no text
I use all lowercase letters as a defence mechanism
I record all of my music with a gooseneck computer mic I bought at Goodwill
I release 3 albums a week
All of my songs have absurdly long titles about absolutely nothing
And I smoke cigarettes but only when someone's taking polaroid pictures of me
If you text at my shows, if you text while I'm playing live, I'll let you know, and I'll complain about it in between songs
I abuse xanax and wear grandpa hats
All.. all of.. all of my songs, all of my songs, all of my songs are written about this one girl that I ate out one time
I'm soaked in irony, it emulsifies from my pores
And I have anxiety, and I'll let you know
Autumn is my favourite season of the year
Don't try and speak to me after my shows, because I'll definitely have a panic attack

Same Old Same Old,rock,Asbo Slipz,2019,7,{},"On the hill in the sacred stones they're
Popping pills while they're on their smartphones
Feel the earth's energy, con-cen-trate
While somone's yelling ""have you got any ket mate?""
I don’t mind, you can take what you want
If it makes you happy and it get's you off but
Just be safe, aware of the side effects
Ten years on, your bladder is a fucking mess

New dawn, new drug
New high, another mug
Same old, same old, same old thing
Getting wrecked in the search for meaning
Drop out, tune in
Feel the rush as your mind spins
Altered reality, chemical flight
Nothing much changes and the kids are alright

And I just don't understand you mate, 'cause
You paid good money just to get through the gate
And there's so much to see, smell, feel, hear, taste
So whydya want to spend it in a comatose state?
Lotus eaters, living on soma
Missing the point - until it's all over
And nobody needs the inevitable drama
Trip to the First Aid tent - bad karma
New dawn, new drug
New high, another mug
Same old, same old, same old thing
Getting wrecked in the search for meaning
Drop out, tune in
Feel the rush as your mind spins
Altered reality, chemical flight
Nothing much changes and the kids are alright

Up to you how you spend your time
How you blow your cash, how you mess up your mind
Experience the dislocation
But all good things in moderation
Live in the moment, stay in the zone
Make good memories, stick em on your phone
There's nothing wrong with trying on the hat
But don't be a zombie, don't be a twat

New dawn, new drug

Get away from it all
Away from high rents

Just dust and sun and sadness
The rents are low, this is true
But there aren't many jobs
And the collars are blue

If you're running from yourself,give it up

Losing you is so easily done

Get busy with it
Got so many flows that I get silly with it
Mmm yeah, let me get chilly and skippy with it
Have a night out get when its been a minute
But don't be that guy trying to get lippy in the dance
Just two step bubble out to the riddim

Ancient horror
From a darker age

Thunder

Sitting on the porch swing thinking about her life
At seventeen she was a mother at nineteen someone’s wife
Time’s been traveling oh so fast she’s watching it pass her by
Remembering her child hood dreams
As she wonders Is there still time

(Chorus)
Is there still time…still time for her to chase her dreams
The ones she left behind…Is there still time
Between the football and the little league
The broken vows and the misery
Can she somehow find the strength
To bring her dreams to life…Is there still time

(Verse)
She closes her eyes and imagines she’s singing on that stage
In front of all her screaming fans everybody knows her name
The man who broke her heart in two sits watching from the crowd
She opens her eyes…covers her mouth then laughs out loud
Is There still time
(Chorus)
Is there still time…still time for her to chase her dreams
The ones she left behind…Is there still time
Between the football and the little league
The broken vows and the misery can she somehow find the strength
To bring her dreams to life…Is there still time

The stone was alive, he could feel it
Breathing beneath his hands
On the table in the kitchen
By the light from the lamp
Burning high with olive oil
He touched the stone, like ice from the sky
Like ice from the eyes of the hangman
He touched the stone and wondered at it
Caressed the coarse rock and was humbled by it
And he knew not why
Why the others hated the stone from the sky
This gem that felt warm amidst all the cold
The breathing and pulsing of life in the stone
And he put out the lamp and crawled into bed
And dreamt of the stone and a tree
And the tree grew up from the stone
Watered with blood in a watering can
The blood of the pen
The pride of the poet lashed to his misery
And up into heaven, a fathomless tree
Where it bore forth wonderful fruit
The fruit of the stars from the womb of the Earth
And he awoke amidst the shudders and sighs
The tears that drip-drip from a faucet of eyes
And he saw the poem written before him
By the olive oil lamp in the kitchen
Of a seed blown far by the winds of the spaces

(One, two, three four)
(Ah)
She was purple, purple
She was purple, purple
She was

[Verse 1]
I give my heartfelt condolences
To the men
Who tried to tame her soul
She was a wild young heart
With a crippling fear of getting old
She had a tongue like Russian roulette
You’d never know which bullet you’ll get
An attraction to the risk
And she fed off the thrill of it

[Chorus]
She was a purple enigma
Violet spark (Violet spark)
The kind that blossomed with fury in the dark
She was a breed like you’d never seen before (Before)
She was a breed they’d never seen before
And when the herders said find your shade of grey
Well she burned brighter just to throw it in their face
She was an unapologetic shade of who she was (She was)
She was purple
(Ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
She was a silent rebellion
Not the type to try and cause a scene
Dangerously aware that she didn’t need a king
To be a queen
She knew that beauty lies in the mind
That everything else will fade with time
She had a love affair with words
Nylon strings and the beauty of verse

[Chorus]
She was a purple enigma
Violet spark (Purple)
The kind that blossomed with fury in the dark
She was a breed like you’d never seen before
She was a breed they’d never seen before
And when the herders said find your shade of grey
Well she burned brighter just to throw it in their face
She was an unapologetic shade of who she was
[Bridge]
Raised on the wonder and fire of Freddie
Her heart was a rhapsody in its own right
Raised on defiance of an early Austen
A revolutionary before her time (Time)
Cause in a world filled with suits and ties
Only interested in dollar bills and white collar lies
She knew that beauty lies in the minds of those filled with poetry
[Chorus]
She was a purple enigma

The kind that blossomed with fury in the dark
She was a breed like you’d never seen before

Fallen from grace, just like the ties
That you severed to this place

Turned on those you used to care about
You took his name, you took his side

I said I won't be there when the going gets rough

You're full of shit
You got me standing at the end of the world

Twisted into parallel worlds

The sky will fall from reality, bury me whole
Burn the sphere of desires your stole
I will break these chains that suffocate
Blood for blood

Clueless Fuck Clue,rap,Jugga the Bully,2004,513,{},"[Verse 1]
I open up Blaze and see these bums all dissin' me
Ernesto don't have a Clue like Unsolved Mysteries
When my album drops I'll be runnin' y'all industry
See me in person bet I get respect from y'all instantly
Fuck y'all sympathy, I call your bluff like card playin'
Now you on the phone with those other faggot A&R's sayin'
""My bad, yo! I ain't know how butta he could be""
Next month you like (""New exclusive shit! Jugga The Bully!!!"")
Got folks askin' me ""Why you got beef with Clue?
That dude got friends..."" That's cool, I got people too
What I'm supposed to do? He gave me a wack write up
Misrepresentin' mine knowin' that it's phat like butts
This nigga couldn't scratch a record in a cat fight plus
Your album sucks, wishin' you could rap like Touch
You just juggle some nuts to get a few exclusives
And thought no one could tell you wack, what the fuck is you stupid?
I question your skills, trashin' every mag that got you in it
And I swear never heard nothin' hot you blended
On my block you finished, I'm ambitious and vicious
And you gonna fall cause real hip-hoppers can't stand bitches
Chorus:
You don't have a Clue
When you disrespect the Dirty South this how we do
Got everyone from here to overseas dissin' too
You don't get no respect here so, Fuuuuuuck Clue!!

[Verse 2]
I heard Clue's hatin', ya words in Blaze is circulatin'
You ain't all that, niggas got you gassed like service stations
In addition, your tapes got too much reverberation
You fucked up and brought an A-T-L-ien Earth invasion
What, you didn't understand the story?
""First Contact's"" a metaphor about weed, nigga, it's self explanitory
Guess you ain't get it, that's what I expect though
Fuck ya mix tape, you ain't special, Ms. Ernesto
With all that echo, tapes headed straight for trash cans
I seen you live, you couldn't mix if your name was TASCAM
Screamin' on all ya tapes to cover up all the mistakes
That's why you never in DJ battles, you'd prolly get raped
Put the plates on, what the FUCK you waitin' on?
Got ya head spinnin' like those twelve hundreds you fakin' on
Puff made you, then that nigga Jigga saved you
Interscope paid you, now Jugga the Bully just played you
I got no beef with artists gettin' run on ya tapes
But if they retaliate, then they, too, gettin' punched in the face
I heard you spin CD's anyway, what's that shit?
Lately your tapes ain't been bangin', it's just wack shit
So fuck you, I won't even mention those other A&R's
Tryin' to clone stars so broke they can't even afford cars
I'm going far regardless, catchin' wreck over beats
You just mad cause ya ass don't get no respect on the streets
Yeah...I expected to see that lump that's in ya throat...
I give ya A&R job two to three months at Interscope
My shit is dope, kill that noise and try me
You the only deejay couldn't scratch if the wax had poison ivy
Chorus

[Verse 3]
I guess you must've felt threatened by mine
Either that or you too dumb to understand what I said in my rhyme
The song was complex, Clue didn't comprehend the context
While everyone who does is sweatin', complementin' concepts
You got yours, why you hatin' on mine?
And I know you got back so fuck the gats this rap is breakin' ya spine
I'm glad you dissed me, and I still got love for New York City
But this nigga's soft like titties, DJ Clue's a sissy
Similar to some of the emcees on that wack shit he play
Fuck The Gay Rapper, Clue's the faggot deejay
Diss The Bully? You nuts like the condoms I skeet in
You wouldn't know original livin' in the Garden of Eden
So pardon the beefin' but I got issues with dude
Not only are your tapes Common, but the bitch is in you
That's why my real niggas no longer listen to you
The President or The Professional? Which is it, Clue?
It ain't President cause you got no campaign funds
If it won't for Jay-Z, where would you get your champagne from?
It ain't Professional cause your whole steez is amateur night
You wanted action? Well, you got it like camera lights
Don't reply, not even teamsters can manage to strike
Got the sound man pissed cause I damaged the mic
It's like this, recognize nigga get ya shit straight
And I might still supply exclusives for ya weak mixtapes
[Chorus]

[Outro]
Big head nigga, fuck you, I'll break your fuckin' fingers
How 'bout that? Know what I'm sayin'? Scratch you with your own needle
Plus nail your turntables down on your knuckles
Don't even matter, talkin' about Jugga the Bully
Talkin' 'bout my shit's wack, you didn't even listen to the shit
If you did, you woulda known what the shit was about
Wouldn't a said that bullshit, know what I'm sayin?
Atlantis UnderWorld, save that clone rap shit
Y'all niggas suck dick for, it's that real shit
I'm tellin' you right now, man, don't even play that bullshit
Motherfucker diss me, talkin' about I'm wack?
That shit y'all heard was just wack, what the fuck?!?
Ignorant ass motherfuckers, man

Let's headbutt clouds, I got a feeling you ain't falling down
Now I've reached a certain understanding what it's all about
Of such a small amount, life is what we talk about
You could be the shortest out, feel like you the tallest now
Go ahead and use me 'cause I'ma use you
And don't worry, I won't judge you if you use too
And you should probably use one, but I'ma use two
Don't be shocked about it, this is somethin' that I'm used to
Just love life with me, 'cause love's fine with me
Just unwind, come fly one time with me
I can feel it now, I'm way above takin' off
The negative, just shake it off, starin' in the face of God
I like to play a lot, play a lot
Maybe you can be the one to make me stop but, then again, maybe not
But, see, I'm knowing I should set you free
Now, my mind'll never let you leave, I think I'm crossing over

[Chorus: Katy B (Sampled)]
I could out your every wrong to right
I will be your sanctuary tonight
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside
I'm the only friend you will need to know
Give me all your troubles, let them go
Crossover and come inside
Crossover and come inside
[Verse 2: Infinite]
Yeah
Late night (late night), another black hole suck us in
We wondering where we are, wonder when the tunnel ends
It doesn't seem close, but I'm feeling good
And I hear that devil in my head, telling me I should
What's the innocent, never missed a step
But, tonight, the steps get harder since we've met
I was getting tired, you were wired, what a bad mix
But it's thriving on a thrill too, so inviting, need to have it
On a tail, I bite, like I ain't have any say
And let the cycle motion on and grab us away
Slow motion like I'm floating when the gravity fades
The lights flashing like I'm out on a stage
I know it's bad, but I doubt I can change
Though I try, but failure doesn't seem to counter the pain
So it helps, though I know it won't last forever
Still, the next day, I'm at it again, I think I'm crossing over

It's way too hot outside
And you can't trust anyone
You've had a long, hard ride
And the day's hardly begun
You've got nothing to lose
They took it all while you looked away
I know you've paid your dues
Do you need somewhere to stay?

Wildlife,pop,Sarah Harmer,2020,188,{},"Night is lonesome with company
And there's a whirlwind kicking around coming after me
Did I become this way slowly row by row
Or was I always this way but didn't know

My upper canines grew like this one week
Wild hair grew thicker on my brow and on my cheek
I've got special needs not filled by day
I'm scaring all the wildlife away

Because I want to be

Of these memories

Lately I've not been myself
I could go out and seek help

Mine's an adventure just like a child's
Rode out the wind til Martini Henry drove me wild
The stars stared back at me again today
I'm scaring all the wildlife away
I did not force my way
Into this unlocked car

To look at the stars

LoveWave/Granny Says,rap,Noa James,2018,13,{Faimkills},"Back in the day
When i was fill with pain
Buried in hate
I heard stories
About a wave
It was a beautiful wave
Then i got brave
Then i got brave
Got me some goal
Got me a purpose
Climb to the surface
Then i found the LOVE WAVE!
Love will set you free
Hate will crush your dreams
Love will give you peace
Hate will steal your sleep
When you start talking about
Love and energy
They  looking at you stupid
But ,if hate is a problem
That means love is solution
I don’t have to prove it
Your mood is your movement
You get what you give
Are you stagnate or your movin?
Are you stagnate or your movin?
Are you stagnate or your movin?
Are you stagnate or your movin?
Are you stagnate or your movin?

See You get what you give
See You get what you give
See You get what you give
Are you stagnate or your movin?

Love is powerful
Hate is powerful
What you do is powerful
Forgiveness is powerful
A smiles are powerful
Compassion is powerful
Faith is powerful
Like you are powerful
Like you are powerful
Like you are powerful

All the power is in your hand
All the power is in your hand
All the power is in your hand
All the power is in your hand
All the power is in your hand
All the power is in your hand
All the power is in your hand
All the power is in your hand

In tuned with my senses
Orca spirit
We sea wolves
We howl at the moon from the distant
My pack is optimistic
My pod got the vision
What love without friction
Love without permission

Arcane and powerful symbols traced on them
Dark and forgotten the times of these writings
Timeless stones shape the walls of this site
In the sacred search of supreme knowledge
May the moon lead my steps
Waiting for his coming
And it was gloom

Somewhere in time
In unknown lands ruled by an ancient magic
6 towers of power were built
In titanic forests
They guarded 6 sacred heirlooms
They show the effigy of the god
Protected by 6 seals
Who sits on the big black throneI mesmerize my soul
To fly along the dusty paths of
Looking for the magic circle of the black ring
Acheron
Toth Amon, prince of enchanters
Tell me your secret
Or I will tear it from death to death
He feeds on blood
Running on a human blood river
His strength glows if the hands
The blood calls him
Invoking him are stained with blood
There the light's kingdoms wobble
Where he shines, the blood is shed
There nature forces are shaken
Thoth-Amon, give me the sword of sacrifice
And the sacred cup I am gonna fill with lifeblood
Give me the lance of almightiness
And the potsherds of the black stone
Entrust the sixth heirloom to me
I'm gonna place on the altar of Dagon
Breast, freezing my soul
And so be it!
And then a whirlwind struck my
Announcing his coming
The candle flames vanished

It is the blood in which I annihilate

Quit the chainin', then I make the lamin', then I hit the blamin'

Myself from strangers
Fears from dreams

Dont Break My Heart,pop,Fragrance,2015,372,{},"(Chorus)
Don't break my heart
Don't let me down
Don't break my heart
Don't make me frown

You took me by surprise
Just like a rainbow in the night
When I look in your eyes
I can see diamonds shining bright

I never realized
You'll be the one to make it right
You got me hypnotized
Before my life was black and white
You and me make a team
I want you near me every day
Last night I had a dream
You went away

(Chorus) (2x)
We're getting serious
Life by your side can be so nice
You're so mysterious
Yesterday you were cold as ice
I wonder how you feel
If all your feelings are the same
Were all your smiles for free

And who is going to suffer from the power in your hand

This walk through an endless path
Of all the obscure shapeless
When life is blood and blood is wrath
Skulls with eyes so senseless
Fire, water, essence of life
Under the skin grow demons and madness
In these godless years of...
Rage: killing, dying...
Yes, we're alone in all mankind
All along this cold eternity
Enduring march with no crosses to bear
All arise from this sepulchre and stop the rest from its womb
Still the godless years are...
I convoke to thee Mephisto, to obtain as a gift what I cannot have by myself, all that remains from thee after waltzing in the dark...
I don't ask for rest, I don't ask for tranquillity (neither body nor the soul), never asked for holiness and neither for thy aid...
One and all were asking (for) this to make thou feel weary
Give all that remains from thee and nobody asked...
Give me risk, I want inquietude
Give me torment, I want battle
Give me uncertainty, I want pain
Now that I ask, that I have the strength
Just give me that, once and for all
Raging on...
The crusade and the grandeur
With the blow of furious winds in our hearts
Lucubrate the (he)art of murder
Raging fuckin' on...
While the demons are growing and the godless years shall never be brought to an end (and the weak ones now lay down slain in the mud and the blood...)

No more loneliness beyond my last breath
Close my eyes
And let me fucking rest

Watch me sink
Deep beneath your feet
Tell me where
Where my soul will take me?

Unconscious thought
Threads the speed of light
Spiraling and absorbing me

A piece of absolution
Realization and confirmation

""Everything is gonna be fine.""

I once imagined that I could fly
But fear of falling killed my will
Dissolving my drive
I like to believe that my will is strong

But when your bones are breaking
Your hands are shaking, how does one carry on?

[Chorus: Brandon Casto]

Just like the old days when we were young
When a smile came naturally

My inspiration to carry on
When I'm tired and crumbling

Get me out of this place
That I decided I'd create
And call reality

Take me somewhere  where sovereignty
Isnt leaving me restless
Leaving me restless

[Verse 2:  Eli Fry]
""Rest"" I dont want to die
But sometimes I hate the feeling of being alive
Crawls on my skull
But under my skin
Screams in my ear
""YOU'LL NEVER WIN. NEVER WIN""
Never fucking win
I feel sick, weak, and alone
So I'm counting down the fucking days
Counting my fucking life away

I can't stand the fucking monotony
This circle is merciless
This instant is endless
And I know I'm not the only one who feels like this

I'll take my heart and my pride
And find a way to escape
This fragile mind and
Let it go
""Let it go.""
Let it go

It’s all obvious every time
No one pressured you into it
It’s all a common story
You see a person
You love like a fire
And when it ends, you hurt
But me

The reason why my heart flutters again
Forgetting that the
Deep scar won’t heal
The reason why my heart flutters
If I know the answer
I would love again

They say you become numb with time
Who said that
My heart is still alive
And my head still remembers
It and won’t be easy, this thing called love
One person leaves
Even if it hurts, it becomes numb with time
And I find love again
And like that

The reason why my heart flutters again
Forgetting that the
Deep scar doesn’t heal
The reason why my heart flutters
If I know the answer
I would love again

I know so well that
It hurts when you break up
But I’m doing it again
With someone else
We dream the same dream
And look for true love

Show me your
One true heart

The Story Of Grumble Tone,misc,Ella Wheeler Wilcox,2013,38,{},"There was a boy named Grumble Tone, who ran away to sea.
""I'm sick of things on land,"" he said, ""as sick as I can be,
A life upon the bounding wave is just the life for me!""
But the seething ocean billows failed to stimulate his mirth,
For he did not like the vessel or the dizzy rolling berth,
And he thought the sea was almost as unpleasant as the earth.


He wandered into foreign lands, he saw each wondrous sight,
But nothing that he heard or saw seemed just exactly right,
And so he journeyed on and on, still seeking for delight.
He talked with kings and ladies grand; he dined in courts, they say,
But always found the people dull and longed to get away
To search for that mysterious land where he should want to stay.


He wandered over all the world, his hair grew white as snow,
He reached that final bourne at last where all of us must go,
But never found the land he sought; the reason would you know?
The reason was that north or south, where'er his steps were bent,
On land or sea, in court or hall, he found but discontent,
For he took his disposition with him, everywhere he went.",133142,en,en,en,there was a boy named grumble tone who ran away to sea im sick of things on land he said as sick as i can be a life upon the bounding wave is just the life for me but the seething ocean billows failed to stimulate his mirth for he did not like the vessel or the dizzy rolling berth and he thought the sea was almost as unpleasant as the earth he wandered into foreign lands he saw each wondrous sight but nothing that he heard or saw seemed just exactly right and so he journeyed on and on still seeking for delight he talked with kings and ladies grand he dined in courts they say but always found the people dull and longed to get away to search for that mysterious land where he should want to stay he wandered over all the world his hair grew white as snow he reached that final bourne at last where all of us must go but never found the land he sought the reason would you know the reason was that north or south whereer his steps were bent on land or sea in court or hall he found but discontent for he took his disposition with him everywhere he went,boy named grumble tone ran away sea im sick things land said sick life upon bounding wave life seething ocean billows failed stimulate mirth like vessel dizzy rolling berth thought sea almost unpleasant earth wandered foreign lands saw wondrous sight nothing heard saw seemed exactly right journeyed still seeking delight talked kings ladies grand dined courts say always found people dull longed get away search mysterious land want stay wandered world hair grew white snow reached final bourne last us must go never found land sought reason would know reason north south whereer steps bent land sea court hall found discontent took disposition everywhere went,Negative,-0.1841269841269841,0.5993055555555555

Of blood, crushing all his dreams

No gold or silver can bring him consolation
Only one thing is left inside him, the desire of revenge

One light so cold and pale, sleeping quietly all alone
One life so old and grey, wandering away from home

Parted with a horrid cry, snow falls on his grief
United by the sword of wicked screams
What deeds he has done to hear those dreadful sounds
In the ruins of memories he wanders, forever bound
Forever bound to death!

Unholy Execution,rap,SickTanicK,2009,71,{},"[Verse 1]
I'm an American terrorist raised up in this wicked nation
Bringing despair by the peoples frustrations
And I'm not Al Queda, I'm a homegrown Satanist terrorist
Who loves to kill a fucking pacifist
You've been found guilty by the jury of the damned
For preachin' beliefs that contradict the left hand
Got a bomb on my chest
And I'm not afraid to use it
Got the power of the devil
Best believe I'm gonna abuse it
On American Christians and Catholics
Fuck the Baptists and the Muslim theatrics
Your god was a bastard, your virgin was a whore
And Muhammed was a faggot
And the Pope molested little boys
Tell me what you wanna know about this dirty bomb shit
Chemical warfare in the land of the free, bitch
The Twin Towers was only the beginning
So indulge in desire
The real terrorism's coming from me

And it took a disaster like this to bring a little unity
That's pathetic and I won't accept that
So I got anthrax, mustard gas and a guest pass
To the white house, I'm fittin' to have some fun
So fuck George Bush, his wife and his bitch ass son
Fuck the Democrats, too, and all of Congress
You wanna imprison the public and you're gonna be haunted
After that I'm off to the Vatican
With a hijacked plane and a mind full of sin
Preachin' their nonsense I'm gonna cause a real ruckus
You want the Devil, well you're gonna get him, fuck it
And as the plane collides the tears fall from your eyes
You're all gonna die and your heaven is denied

[Hook:]
Welcome, Welcome, To My, Unholy Execution
Welcome, Welcome, To My, Unholy Execution
Welcome, Welcome, To My, Unholy Execution
Welcome, Welcome, To My, Unholy Execution
[Verse 3]
Say farewell to the flesh, our most prized possession
And during the exorcism I took the Devil's blessings
And now I got C4 strapped to my chest
As I enter the church I said give god your best
'Cause your all about to die and your faith means nothing
And where the hell you goin' to you're not runnin'
And I'm gunning for every church in America
I'm gonna show 'em their worth through hysteria
As a pile of ashes I blast this
Murder is my drug, motherfuckers and I've become an addict
So don't panic on the plane when I'm by you
Just grab your nuts, motherfucker, and let me show you the truth
There is no God or a war for oil
It's only me on this earth and I'm in control
So when the big bomb busts are you gonna be awake
In your city I'm killin' and this is real and not fake, uh

You brought me up and hid me from the torment of this cruel world and now, like a son without his mother, I face this hell with nowhere to turn. I face this hell with nowhere to turn

How could I ever forget the way you suffered? The way you showed me love you’d never felt from another. Yet I had the nerve to curse your name when all you did was show me comfort

Looking back, how did you ever have the will to keep a loving heart when everything you held onto had left you in the dark? From your stolen youth to your crooked lovers. Living in one state, moving to another. You somehow have the room in your heart to love somebody like me. Now I’m setting the record straight. Letting it all come through, I’m putting ink to the page. I realize that this was never your fault and I’m sorry

As hard as I’ve tried to frame you as the cause of all the mistakes I’ve tangled myself in, bridges I’ve burned at both ends, and my own self-loathing…I cannot paint such a picture any longer. I’ve spent so long holding in this bitter taste and now all I want is to remember your sweetness. But I know that through coffins, beds, love, and regret we’ve made for ourselves…this life is ours, so we live it

I’d fall in your arms like your leading lady
You’d steal every scene along with my heart
Til the credits all roll, cuz it’s only for show
When you live, in, black and white

Waving at trains,pop,Heinz Rudolf Kunze,2011,18,{},"[Strophe 1]
If there was anything to say
I've said it all
My special way
If there was anything to do
I've done the best
I could for you
And if there's something that ramains
It's nothing but waving at trains
Nothing but waving at trains

If there was something I forgot
I'm pretty sure
There was a lot
I didn't mean you any harm
I overheard
The last alarm
Seems I'm just happy when it rains
So busy with waving at trains
So busy with waving at trains

Time
As all old lovers say
Is a healer
We've long lost that belief
Time
No matter how we pray
Is a stealer
Why can't it steal our grief

[Strophe 3]
If there is something I can do
To ease your hurt
Get through to you
Just dial my number let me know
Don't be afraid
To let it show
Reach out for me I'll share your pains

Dirty Blvd. Animal Serenade,rock,Lou Reed,2004,20,{},"Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
His father beats him cause he's too tired to beg

He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard

He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
He's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard

This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
You can believe it man it's true
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard

Get 'em out, on the dirty boulevard
Going out, to the dirty boulevard
They're going down, on the dirty boulevard
Going out

Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the Mean Streets

A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard

Diamonds In The Coal
Diamonds In The Coal
My name is jackson jameson, a coal miner by trade
From a part of pennsylvania even jesus couldn't save
With towns named after indian chiefs and union army generals
It's nowhere in particular but everywhere in general

History says americans, we have the right to choose
But they never mention those of us whose opinions aren't used

Well, the big flood came in '72 and tore the railroad bridges down
Washed away our only means of getting shipments out of town
And the government won't subsidize rebuilding the central line
So there's barroom fights and anthracite and loads of extra time

History says americans, we have the right to choose
But they never mention those of us whose opinions aren't used

There's diamonds in the coal everybody ignores
A man never finds what he ain't looking for
A tree only grows if you nurture the seed
There's too many gems this world doesn't need

The people left like rainwater flowing through an open drain
But here i sit too proud to admit and too damn old to change
Now, the monuments at gettysburg keep the tourists going there

Said you got some things to show me
Give it to you how you want it
Then it’s cheese, eggs in the morning
You got a smile that's hard to miss
With a booty so fat, make it hard to sit
I got bands like a parliament
Treat your body like a brick, it ain't hard to flip
Whip it real good, whip it whip it real good
Your man can't do it like I could leave that boy like big foot
Jump in we about to take off and the room is so clean
But the leather so soft let your head down and cool got no top
The party don't stop we do what we want
[Refrain: LunchMoney Lewis]
So let it whip child
Let it whip
Whip it, whip it
No time to trip, child
So move your hips
Move your hips
And whip it

[Hook: Chloe Angelides]
We can go all night, so don't be shy
I'm 'bout to blow your mind
Come on baby, whip it one more time
Just hold on tight, gon' be a bumpy ride
Come on baby, whip it
Come on baby, whip it

[Bridge: LunchMoney Lewis]
Dance, get low
Make it bounce, bounce
Put your hands on your knees while you working it out
Bounce, make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Put your hands on your knees while you working it out
And make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Put your hands on your knees, while you working it out
Make it bounce (like a basketball), bounce, bounce
Put your hands on your knees while you working it out

Romanticizing thoughts of killing myself
Staring at the jar of pills on my shelf
I'm not really depressed I'm fucking pressed and only think of myself
How do I plan to keep it up I only think of the belts
Talking crazy, like, I wonder if they hit me would I flip?
I tend to get a little trippy when I'm lit
Talk about a side effect I might be a little melodramatic
The fellow’s an addict, a.d.d. just adds to my havoc
I'm spending money no fucks given, drunk driving fuck with him
Empty bottles in the trunk, holding up cups sipping
What's really living if i'm not scared of death?
Going 120 and man were all scared to death
I'm sick and I love sinning, drunk driving fuck living
Empty bottles stacking up, po’ing up cups sipping
I really think i'm indestructible, fucking my body up
I'm taking any fucking drug if it's fundable

On a piano, all tired out and marred

And the stone angel hung on the wall up above
Looked out blind all the nights long
But when the one-armed man played to an empty saloon
She looked down and smiled as he played her his songs

Never leavin' the back of the bar
Would climb up on the stage and curl up around his feet
As to guard him and his music from harm

And the stone angel hung on the wall up above
Looked out blind all the nights long
But when the one-armed man played to an empty saloon
She looked down and smiled as he played her his songs

I heard him one night when he thought to be alone
And I lied and I did him a wrong
I can't give back the pleasure his music gave to me
I can only give him this song
He played better with one hand than most men with two
Yet made posters for all of the stars
And I wish to my heart he could play for you

They saw a bright new shining star
And heard a choir from heaven sing
The music came from afar

Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her Child
Not a single room was in sight

Niggas Wit' Attitudes
Niggas Wit' Attitudes

[Refrain: Ice Cube]
I'm comin' straight outta Compton

[Refrain: Ice Cube]
When somethin' happens in South Central, Los Angeles
Nothin' happens. It's just another nigga dead (dead)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit' Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm goin' out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showin' out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo
Goin' off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat, that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin' when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act the motherfuckin' fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin' niggas out the box, daily
Yo', weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighbourhood, you better duck
'Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back, boy, I'm comin' straight outta Compton
[Interlude: MC Ren]
Y'all, a-oh, a-oh

[Interlude: DJ Yella]
City of Compton!
City of Compton!

[Eazy-E & MC Ren]
Yo, Ren
What's up?
Tell them where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin' the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is jackin'
And when I'm illegally armed, it's called packin'
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho'
You'll probably get mad like them bitches are 'posed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, 'cause I'm tearin' up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker, that starts static
Not the right hand 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time, I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' Villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's takin' place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip
Straight outta Compton!
[Interlude: DJ Yella]
City of Compton!
City of Compton!

[Pre-Verse: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Straight outta Compton, is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfuckin' cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kind of funny, the attitudes showin' a nigga drivin'
But don't know where the fuck he goin', just rollin'
Lookin' for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, you see, it's about to over the hesitation
And hear's the scream of the one, who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin'
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin'
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken, by a stupid dope brotha' who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

Doesn't have much to talk about

Emotions are all the same
Maybe just love and lonliness

That's when the sky cries for him and

The lightning strikes
He's mesmerized

Oh, super me
You're all that I long to

Slowpoke,rock,Dave Brockie Experience,2003,341,{},"[Spoken]
This here is the story of Slowpoke, the slowest dick in the west

[Verse 1]
Slowpoke met a woman, tried to fuck her on a train
He took so long she fell asleep, woke up, then slept again
Finally got his dick out, tried to fuck her on a plane
It took off, flew 'round, landed, then just took right off again

[Chorus]
Slowpoke stick your dick in, quit beating 'round the bush
All you need's a glob of spit, a hole, and one good push
If you don’t make a booty call, our line will soon expire
Come on Mister Slowpoke, go make your dick perspire

[Verse 2]
Slowpoke got all wasted, had to go to outer space
Met a mutant Ewok with a faggot for a face, he said
""Hey Slowpoke, gonna make your dick throw up""
Slowpoke took so goddamn long, the shuttle just blew up
[Chorus]
Slowpoke stick your dick in and give that thing a push
All you need's a dildo and the guy who sings for Bush
Maybe cuz yer dick's so big, you just can’t find the end
Slowpoke with your big fat dick, you'll be my big fat friend

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Slowpoke is a constellation whose light will never die
Pinned in eternal blackness kinda like a butterfly
And next to him's a naked lady made of shining stars
Just a dick-length outta reach, but that's one lick too far

[Chorus]
Slowpoke got retarded and I swear the pussy parted
And I think my doggy farted, oh
If you don't make a booty call, our line will soon expire
Maybe 'cause your dick's so big, you should go fuck a tire

What Goes Around Comes Around,rap,J Lye,2012,421,"{""Ja Far""}","Verse 1 (J. Lye):
Karma, they call it a bitch
But I can't even fuck it, so at least she let me hit
I'm looking in her eyes while shes looking at the ground
I found out what she did, since then I hear no sound
Deaf, threw out the red like a ref
I must be underwater, because I can't take a breath
I guess i've been cursed, ever since I hurt them first
But I'm hoping in my heart that her pain is far worse
Damn, standing still like im in traffic
I try to recollect but the pain is too graphic
Trying to find the next one, so can you hurry please?
But when I find her, now im stuck with insecurities
Got me staring out the window to the clouds
Cupids got a gun and I am struck with every round
Struck with every bullet, but im begging him to pull it
Got me swearing to myself that I am done with all the bullshit
But I know that in my heart she got me running back
But I would never corey dillon, no running back
Mascara down her face, tears dripping black
And I be looking to my life trying to get intact
So let me spit up on the final facts
Money going over females counting stacks
And any nigga that im ever seeing with her
Want to let you know that I would really reconsider (J)
Interlude:
(sparks lighter)
I mean throughout life
You find it doesnt matter who you are
Your gonna have your ups and downs
But you ain't gotta believe me
Let my nigga talk to you...go

Verse 2 (Ja Far):
Losing touch man, so complicated
Heavy stress so I'm steady getting more faded
Sophomore reason, this a blessing man
Watching as shes feeding me doses of my medicine
I been meddling, women get hectic
Shit will pop off, relationships are pyrotechnic
If it, goes around then it come right back
Feeling locked down, my head is like a bicycle rack
I gotta slip my gear, get my shit together
She wearing me out, something like a varsity letter
I'm better than that, taught you I could make you believe
Then I went and dropped the ball, just like its new years eve, uh
Late night texting, so perplexing
Tic tac toe shit, all these exes

Hey, no one sees I wanna hoot that crowd

Nowhere Left to Drive,rock,Panda Circus,2010,26,{},"It was a February evening, and I got this funny feeling
I was thinking something wasn’t right
Everything was quiet again, and it had already been
Six weeks since we last had a fight
And we tried to talk it over, but I wasn’t really sober
I could tell things were getting rough
She said ""I think it might be best if we started heading west
Tell me when you think we’ve gone far enough""

First we drove to L.A. just to prove it exists
Then we left the next day saying we wouldn’t miss it
We changed our minds drove to Montreal
Passed through Salt Lake City and Saint Paul
Then we went to Dallas and San Anton’
And anyplace was someplace else to go
Our car broke down, so we hitchhiked home
Stole a brother’s truck and drove to Mexico

And if there’s nowhere left to drive
Well that’s fine
We’ll have time
Sit and watch our lives go by
You got a look in your eyes like you’re trying to hide
And I know we’re both terrified
But there’s no one else for miles
Maybe we could be ourselves just for the night
Well April came and went, and we were still bent
On finding out what was next
So we continued heading south, and there wasn’t any doubt
That our endurance would be put to the test
Well we got to Ecuador, we were getting kind of bored
So we found a restaurant that looked just right
We can look at the landscape of Porto Villa
And listen to the music all night
She said ""I’ve never felt more like myself
Then when I was just like you
But I can’t tell who you are anymore
What the hell am I supposed to do?""
I said ""I know we’ve got our problems
But I’m sure they’ll disappear
When we get to Spain or Greece or North Korea
Or anywhere but here.""

And there’s nowhere left to drive
Well that’s fine
We’ll have time
Sit and watch our lives go by
I can see it in your eyes we’re going to be alright
And there’s nowhere left to drive
Well that’s fine

What Great Love Is This?? Adoption,rap,Timothy Brindle,2012,479,"{""Believin\\' Stephen""}","[Intro]
From the beginning Scripture tells the story of the restoration of the children of God /

[Verse 1: Timothy Brindle]
Dude please turn the page / Adam was a human son of God it says in Luke 3:38 / he was made in His likeness / created as righteous / as God's son he knew His embrace and His brightness / but Adam sinned so exiled from His presence / plus his sin now has defiled his descendents / so Israel was God's son / out of Egypt I called you (Hosea 11:1) / and so were the kings of Judah (read it in Psalm 2) / but they all were exiled for their wicked grievous sins / disqualified from sons by their disobedience / (but we're all God's children) often they echo / but by nature we're children of wrath (our father's the devil) / and he wanted our death like we're his abortions / cut off from the Father (spiritual orphans) / no rights as sons / any righteous? (none) / the Father's only pleased with what Christ has done /

[Hook]
Oh what great love is this? / that the Father gave His obedient Son to take the punishment / for the sons of disobedience so our new status as sons is won / He gives us Jesus's / see what kind of love that the Father's given us / (sent His son) so we live it up / as sons with privileges / see what kind of love that the Father's given us / we've been forgiven much so our life we give it up /

[Verse 2: Believin' Stephen]
Christ was baptized then you hear the Father speak this / this is My Son in whom I'm well pleased with / His words were certain / was born of a virgin / He surely was perfect / yeah the worthiest Servant / the Son was with the Father in eternity past / He perfectly grasped His role as Son / you can check His purpose and path / was intimate with the Father He'd worship and fast / all of His days He always obeyed / honest like Abe we deserve to be smashed / He was offering praise / but then He fervently asked for the cup to pass but the Father was turning His back / He was cursed on behalf of us so we wouldn't burn in the chaff / yet He averted His wrath and Satan the serpent was smashed / now I can go to the Father and make my fears known / Jesus is God's Son (not Nasir Jones) / my Lord is blood-dripped / and it poured abundant / His work on the cross is surely what secures our sonship /

[Verse 3: Believin' Stephen & Timothy Brindle]
My thoughts are wild / yeah they're rotten foul / I know my sins list long but Christ tossed the files / by faith in Him / I'm an adopted child / plus thanks to Him I always have the Father's smile / Christ pleased the Father / He is the Potter / the sonship includes the ladies because she's His daughter / He is so mighty / I seem so tiny / but His Word says I am an heir (air) / no Nike / the fullness of the kingdom that He's building abroad / is for the freedom of the glory of the children of God / raised up in the glorified bodies He bought them / sons of God in the fullness of adoption / we'll praise the Father for His works believer / in the New Earth the Son will be our worship leader / towards His children yo He'll never have disgust / cause His love for His Son is the love He has for us /

All white, dressing by the bed, and hummed a melody of a song you know I hate

And I learned in time to curse myself, and lost the money that I'd won, but as hopeless as the haunted, they're a cold white moon
And all night, I am misery or dragging cloud, in an old stone house
And all night, I am torn between an endless spin and a pale girl
Fly blown in the mire, owed all in line, and laid by the wheel
But all was a dream, cold white moon hung over me
And I curse myself, moon glow over me, cold white moon glow over me

Woke in piss and in blood, face down on the floor, 'no love no talk no contact', each man is living, each is told

Promise we the sickest
Promise we the baddest
If ya lookin' for perfect, you might as well keep on searching
They cancel the most deserving, who are they really serving
Gifts are created for stirring, not to be stagnate and burning
Images made for earning, who are they really serving

I want big smoke
Wolfing on the net but up in person, they got strep-throat
Hear they make a lot of threats but they don't ever step though

They gon' say that Aha evil just because his neck glow
Running your mouth you should be running through a check bro
Yeah they curse me out behind my back but I'm still blessed though
Tell the chauffeur park and let me out right where the guests go
Go rehearse with Ruff and then we cool until the next show
May rock a hoodie with some slides we don't do dress codes
Yeah, we Free Barabbas but look like we signed with Death Row
All the love, they showin' fake but still wish them the best though
I know you don't like me but you still gon' show respect hoe
Watch them prove they really Christian then reject folk
Thought they'd show forgiveness but somethings that they can't let go
I don't do religion wipe 'em down and disinfect those
Jesus flipped the table that they want to go dissect on
Always talking 'bout some Pro-Life they be dead wrong
Make a post bout BLM and watch how fast they get gone
What if God went ghost on you when Karen got her meth on
Aha here to tell the truth, I'm not the one to rep on
Say I'm not humble because I get my flex on
Humbleness is in your heart quit looking at my skin tone
All they do is use His Word in vain and they inject on
But Aha don't fool with needles,  all I want is

Too Much,pop,Andrew Huang,2013,6,{},"[Intro]
Ooh, let me be honest with you
Make you a promise, it's true
Do what you want me to do
Ooh, let me be honest with you
Make you a promise, it's true
Do what you want me to do

[Verse 1]
How am I supposed to say it
When we've both been jaded too much too much
How am I supposed to do it
When I'm close to you it's too much too much
How am I supposed to say it
When we've both been faded too much too much
How am I supposed to do it
When I'm close to you it's too much too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, let me be honest with you
Make you a promise, it's true
Do what you want me to do
Ooh, let me be honest with you
Make you a promise, it's true
Do what you want me to do
What I need to be the next big thing:
Cut back and clip these ripped wings
What I need to be the next big thing:
Get on board a ship that's sinking

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to say it
When we've both been jaded too much too much
How am I supposed to do it
When I'm close to you it's too much too much
How am I supposed to say it
When we've both been faded too much too much
How am I supposed to do it
When I'm close to you it's too much too much

[Verse 2]
I figured things out late in the game
Too much time making a name
But I'm still taking the train
Hard work, but I'd exaggerate to be saying
That I'm staking the pain
Like a vampire slayer insane
Layers of strange wisdom taken with grains of salt
I cracked so many locks, you ought to change the vault
I break it down to the basic elements
If it sounds intelligent
It's probably even harder than you're bound to settle with
Not loud and evident, not proud and prevalent
Just grounded elegance
That the world crowns with sediment
You're dealing with a rounded veteran
'Cause I make this new sound competitive
I found a sedative: your disc in the used bin
An ounce repetitive
Talking about your pounds of medicine
This comic con artist makes all you clowns irrelevant
So get a grip
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, let me be honest with you
Make you a promise, it's true
Do what you want me to do
Ooh, let me be honest with you
Make you a promise, it's true
Do what you want me to do

What I need to be the next big thing:
Cut back and clip these ripped wings
What I need to be the next big thing:
Get on board a ship that's sinking

City Of Sickness intro,rap,Drrty Pharms,2018,14,{},"I live in a city of sickness
Disparity and addictions
For money i feed fixes
For pussy i feed vixens
When desperate ive made victims
Ive lied and forced and tricked them
A hopeless broken system
A breeding ground for prisons

I live in a city of vultures
And melting pot of cultures
A soup of soot and sulfur
Thats bound to give you ulcers
I watch the people suffer
And try to fuck each other
In darkness we get vulgar
Revealing our true colors

I live in a state of depression
Where kids shoot up as freshman
Where tension never lessens
Im void of all affections
Now lifes a competition
For natural selection
And people lose ambition
After they face rejection
The city feeds addictions
With powders and injections
The cities full of sickness
Its one giant infection

Pirates,rap,Curci,2018,640,"{""Mick Jenkins""}","[Chorus: Curci]
Whole lot of pirates
Lookin' for high risk
Searching for idols
See through your iris
No foolin' a giant
Feel the wrath of a tyrant
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough

[Verse 1: Curci]
I’ve been searching my soul
Looking for diamonds and gold
Thinking how far does it go?
Can I buy love at a store?
Really how much are they running me for?
Are they conning for more
Look, I can see the greed in their eyes now
Trying to show their teeth when they lie
But I will never lie down
Enemies on the line now
Gotta get the high ground, take a step and get sniped down
Who’s got the highest price?
Who’s got the ruby eye?
You know everyone has a price
Who’s got the sharpest knife
Picking at diamond mines
Keep a short leash on them dogs of mine
Goonies they never die
My valentines follow the dollar signs
Hard to not compromise
When you never had shit to begin with
Picking up tricks in your interest
Rather get rich in the trenches
Man I'm talking big business
Where their morals are smaller than inches, get hip to the system or sleep with the fishes, outsmart the vindictive
Don't become a victim
[Chorus: Curci]
Whole lot of pirates
Lookin' for high risk
Searching for idols
See through your iris
No foolin' a giant
Feel the wrath of a tyrant
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
That’s why you gotta look for yourself
Do not live your life on another man's word
Open up these books for yourself
You would get shook by the truth too
Start to see crooks by the Buku
Connections unseen like the Bluetooth
Or the WiFi
Found facts that I can’t deny
I had to change my eye
Which is a fancy way of saying nigga's switch perspective
No auto-tune found my pitch perfected
Figure why a nigga felt so disconnected
Introspective questions answered with deflection
In the mirror no reflections
Was severely misdirected
And then that shit gets dismissed from recollection when I'm sky high
We could shoot the breeze
No drive by
I be Drew Brees with the knowledge of a Rabbi
Kobe send some shooters, keep a Raja Bell with me
Bare with me, grow with me , share with me
[Chorus: Curci]
Whole lot of pirates

I'll bring the drama all throughout your lobby
Control dead crowds like I'm rocking from the zombies
From where the snobby and pomp are, they're Abercrombie & Fitch
I'm such an animal while handling brew shit
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
Soft niggas be spitting, think they flow is the cool whip
Til' I'm leaving with they pie and taking off in they new shit, shit
These fiends wouldn't even come close to how we sticking niggas up whenever suckers approach
They didn't know we're creeping close like a bug or a roach
More blunt smokes spared, bout the Murder, She Wrote
It's lethal
Shit I be spitting is like pins and needles
And it should probably be illegal, half the shit I spit from my cerebrum
So keep stuntin' like you Evil Knievel, to find your body on a Ski-Doo in the back of your cathedral

Part 2:

And sometimes I am sad, but I don’t know the reason

All this bad things everyday
In my head. It’s a game

Only we can win this thing

Part 3:

We’re driving through the sunset
In fact I feel so glad
I think that moment never ends
You choose to make me mad
So you’re driving away
But hey its a game
I think it is game over and I have to be a lover
With no love in my system
My heart is broken, listen
Not a noise, not a beat and I’m trying to keep
But no music
To hold me back
With a track
In that moment
Everything is black

It seems that they're so determined to maintain their status that after piecing themselves back together, every last resource went to restoring their own normality over aiding the survival of anyone else

Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey my next thirty years I’m going to have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done
Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears
And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years

[Verse 3]
My next thirty years I’m going to settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I’m doing here
In my next thirty years

[Verse 4]
Oh my next thirty years, I’m going to watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years
[Verse 5]

Reoccurring thoughts left undefined
Stream of mental anguish eerily defiled
Flows through passages of the undivine
Disturbed covenant spawning malevolence
Gods clash in unbridled abhorrence
Contrived hymns chanted to ease the mind
Of forlorn disciples forever blind
Dreaming bleeding faces of man created gods
Bathing in abundant torrents nourished by their blood

Growing stronger as I feed my senses bloom
Feasting on this inexorable opulent carnage
Blood soaked I indulge in this omnipotent lineage

Corrupting your way to complete domination

And lay your body down beside my love
Surrender to my warm embrace and know that

And I can't make you disappear
But I promise not to leave you anywhere alone
Let my love replace your fear

You doubt the truth I told you in the silence

Played by the devil make me cynical, think of the opposites

Smother you with all the latest exaggerations
Sedated, inebriated soul charged with emotions
Take a swig of this to see the universe frozen, mmm… I like that!

何はともあれ just life is… Something like that
I float in space… watch you walkin' through the Golden Gate
The phase that I pass is like a glitch, how can I miss that?
The risk factor is astronomical…
Sound effects spark imaginations, every syllable
Is crisp and clear, once upon a time I felt like God was light years away
But He said,｢FEAR NO MAN｣,then my eyes opened
Forget the lies of deceiving mouths and rise from the dark to see the light
Beautiful in the eyes of the beholder
I wrote a thousand letters, signed and delivered, but I can't find the
Right words to describe this vibe…
Looking at my Francks' it's about that time
Hey yo, think about it for sec, it ain't hard to see
We-dress-to-kill…
Live from the city that don't know how to sleep
Tell me how-you-feel…
Ooh… I'm all shook up!

Taking the Easy Way Home,pop,David Scobie,1980,154,{},"Close your eyes, think awhile
Before we call it a day
Turn around, try to smile
Smile as you walk away
It ain't easy leaving
Don't you know even heroes cry
I don't know the reason
I just know it ain't easy, all the time

It's funny how we've seen somehow
Strangers saying goodbye
It's what we had, is over now
Maybe we flew too high

I won't find it easy and
I know your leaving will trouble me
But I got a feeling that maybe you're really hurt more than me

I know it might sound vain
But really it's not that way
It's just that I found my way
I'm taking the easy way home, I'm ok
Taking the easy way home, I'm alright
Taking the easy way home
Cause, I'm finally on the road
Another way to go
Trying some other song to sing along the line
I'm going home

I'm taking the easy way home
Taking the easy way home

I've had my fears, cried my tears
And learned alot on the way
I've hurt my pride, through the years
But, now they're all yesterday
So baby believe me that maybe your leaving will trouble me
But I got a feeling that maybe you hurt more than me

I know it might sound vain
But really it's not that way
It's just that I found my way

I'm taking the easy way home, I'm ok
Taking the easy way home, I'm alright
Taking the easy way home
Cause I'm finally on the road
Another way to go
Trying some other song to sing along the line
I'm going home
I'm taking the easy way home
Taking the easy way home

I'm taking the easy way home (easy way home)
I'm taking the easy way home (easy way home)
I'm taking the easy way home (easy way home)
I'm taking the easy way home (easy way home)
I'm taking the easy way home (easy way home)

Take It to the Bed,rb,Evan Croft,2017,173,{},"Intro:
Glowing, glowing your body is glowing x2

Verse 1:
Damn, your body's glowing
I can’t contain myself
Wanna be all over that body
And claim it for myself
Come & wrap your thighs all around my waist
Baby please on my cheek just a taste

Have a seat on the couch
Somewhere you can’t be missin’
Let me stare at you, then close the gap
And babe, when we done our kissin’

Chorus:
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of talking it out)
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of yelling and screaming and pleading)
You know I’m not known for my patience
I want your body and its beautiful fragrance
So how about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet, sweet love
Verse 2:
From your head to your toes
I know your body knows
You want me too just as bad as I want you
And you think you’ll like it too
The way I'll hit your spot
Girl I'll get your heart unlocked
Say my name don't ever stop
Just one night is not enough
You know I don't mean no harm
I love to have you in my arms
Glowing brighter than the stars
Now this bed is hotter than on mars

Chorus:
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of talking it out)
How about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet love instead (of yelling and screaming and pleading)

I want your body and its beautiful fragrance
So how about we take it to the bed
And make some sweet, sweet love

Get ready cause I'm gonna give it
You gonna get it

We come rushing through your stereo system
Into your ear canal
Like the alignment of the solar system

No more lies

Like someone tryin' to sneak up on the guest list
Play for a team that's called ""not to mess with""
And check out the scenario

Control your stereo

Can't let this hold us
Let's be soldiers
No longer let them control us

And what we know
Then bounce 'til ya lose control

Turn up the heat while we get this started

It's starting to feel like the more that I climb
Is actually just the farther I'll fall
I'm lost and it's all
Cause I'm trying to spark a fire
Fuck forgot a lighter
Plus everyone wants to be stalling the thaw
That's hardly at all a good excuse
For loosing to new ""improved"" looney tunes
That claim that their bars are the raw-est
Maybe the weed that's given me plausible cause
To be an enemy to any lyrically conquerer of song
Like Chris Brown I can kill it stomping the yard
But this round I'm sitting still in ponder and awe
At that, the reality is, the fatalities
Are happening now to the kids
Whom cower in fear cause they can't stand out or be weird
Without being told down by their peers
And called foul nouns and adjectives
It's so sad, wanna go back
But somethings allowing me to just blow past
I know that, if we hold fast

Say Im Sober,pop,Billy Lockett,2019,3727,{},"[Verse 1]
Flushed out the demons

And I've been trying
But it don't come easy to me
It don't come easy to me

[Verse 2]
Total disaster
Grew like a cancer in my chest
And in the laughter
Was it pain I thought I'd left?

But I've been trying
But that don't come easy to me

And I've been working hard to heal
But nobody gonna feel what I feel

[Chorus]
And now
I've been tryna break it down to build it up
I've been tryna tell myself I'm good enough
So, tell me it's over, say I'm sober
And I'm done
Done with staying out all night until the dawn
Saying I'm alright to cover up the storm
So, tell me it's over, say I'm sober

Stitch back together by a thread
I know I'll never
Be the same inside my head

But the flames are getting higher
Every day's a little harder on and on
Goes on and on
So, I live like it's my last
Keep the pain inside the past
I won't go back, won't go back

Go on let it out
Go on let it out

Money ain't shit besides a way to pay the rent
Before I touch man it's already spent
My nigga I ain't flossin'
Unless it's early in the morning and I'm finna be out the door to attempt to open some doors yeah I try it often
Trying often just to keep my head above the waters
Of the ocean they try and throw me in don't compare me
To another nigga story better reference my author my pages
Still being creative my niggas done think I made it
My dreams are farther than whatever expectations you making
My attention is vacant so your statements you can keep them mane
I really got my own way that I been thinking mane
Got my own lane and I ain't speeding
Just another evening that I'm smoking up and writing down this shit
Is right around the corner manifested been backed into a corner
But fuck being in a walking coma
I'm bout to make moves
Broke niggas trying to pay dues
The end of the day just try to stay cool
Like my OG informed me to do
He told me that pride sometimes can create fools
And over time time will expose them to you
Show and prove I show what I prove to be nothing but real
You nothing but frail
I don't know how you niggas deal
With the cards you giving if you shuffling your hands
Put em back in the deck and then just try this shit again
Put me in the deck and then you'll probably understand
The stance of a brotha who be living under the umbrella
Of life staying prepared for the rain
Couple of drops done touched me but I really can't complain
No I really can't
[Hook: Anti-Lilly & Scolla]

Uh, they tell me to take my time
I twist an L and breath in
Inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breath out, breath out
Breath out, breath out

I say amen as a man on his own feet they never get cold
My laces never get old
Take a walk in my sneaks get a stare at the road
See what I'm faces on the day to day
May be the same you may see it in another way
But I ain't judging your vision my nigga
Everybody got a different prescription my nigga
We all can become blind if we don't let the light shine through
Don't get lost in opinions my n igga find you
I'll never let a nigga tell me where I'm headed
Go behind the measure of any ruler except the one in heaven
My mind is a weapon protecting what's mine
Dropping mines every time I drop a line you niggas tread lightly
Feeling some type of way about these village of sheep

TAKEN,rap,JayTee the Aussie,2019,17,{},"[Chorus]
Taken, mistaken, forsaken,  all shaken
Hating, awaken, one nation, all shaken
All these words they be so bendy
And you know I touch her gently
Rolling up with all this henny
Yeah I do not drive a Bentley

[Verse 1]
Pick it up, bash him up, fuck it up, yeah
Go hard, got bars, drive cars, aye
I take my music serious
I treat all people with respect
They say that I’m delirious
I catch you with a fishing net
Yeah I gotta switch up my flow
Or else my music is gone blow
Making all that same stuff
What I’m saying never be a bluff
Imma try to go so fast
Sad life coming from past
Never failed a test cos I didn’t miss a class
All fake people smell like ass
I’ve been taken by emotions
Isolation really stinks
Not trynna make a big commotion
I do not even blink
I do not even nod my head
All day I want to go to bed
All day I swear I only dread
Getting caught, by the feds
Only cos I download movies
Yeah my vibe is so groovy
Being lonely took me down
Sometimes I feel like I’m gonna drown
This path I’ve never seen before
Glad I dodged that fucken whore
I don’t need the toxicity
The pettiness is killing me
I cannot take you seriously
Avoiding you is my ability
I don’t know what I’m saying
All these words they be so wack
This music I be creating
The Maturity that you lack, lack
Taken, JayTee

Rolling up with all this henny

[Verse 2]
I know my music sounds the same
Writing lyrics is so hard
Trying to acquire fame
Did not get a Christmas card
I know I say that I get bitches
But the truths I really don’t
Only thing I got is stitches
Slim Shady is the goat
Yeah I bag out other rappers
Even though I am unknown
I know I’m like those other rappers
But I am on smoko
Aussie rap makes it different
Mumble rap its all the same
Out here trynna make a difference
Mumble rap can be so lame
Someone get me back on track
My raps keep going off the rails
Lay me down on my back
Ill crush you like a group of snails
I always get taken away
Someone, something I never know
Let me go n earn my pay
I guess I can’t switch up my flow
Okay I’m done cya later
I bite you like an alligator

It's in my bloodline (Bloodline)
Better hug your dog if you love 'em 'cause I can't hug mine (On God)
Retaliate, we put 'em up, lil' bitch, I slung iron (Blatt)
Locked in a cell, I got out of jail and I still done crime (Why?)

[Verse 1: MO3]
This why I still be in my feelings (Why?)
Maybe 'cause the bitch that I'm loving be acting different (Ha)
Don't respect the fact I'm working on what we building (What?)
And I ain't forgot the pain, I'm just working on my forgiveness
Section 8, I'm thugging, got killers all in my trenches (For real)
Clutching, I got action, get at me, this shit get wicked
Chopper flip 'em like a gymnast, yeah, without no blindfold
Treat an opp just like a surfboard, yeah, when I slide on
[Verse 2: Morray]
Full of passion, bare the fruit of everlasting shit
Tell me they love me, but they hate me, I'm the last they pick
Under construction 'cause destruction what I always get
I went from selfless to selfish, they hating like a bitch
Niggas will plot on you, scheme on you
It's love 'til the beam on you
Fuck you over, when it's done, still gon' say what they need from you
Ain't no friends left to build with
Tools in hands, but we ain't building
Niggas praying for my downfall 'cause they know I got real shit
It's like hating is the fucking way of life now
Talking down on my name make haters so proud
Extra silent when I speak because my guns loud
Preach the positive, but still won't put my guns down
I don't bang, you get banged if you ever try to check this
Feel like MO3, for sure, G, showing love to Texas
On a song with my dog, I'm getting features from Heaven
I'ma try to emulate you, but I know nobody better

Why you actin' like we homies, you ain't ever wanna help, man
I'll just do it by my lonely, you know imma do it well, man
Ain't lookin' out for the phonies, wanna look out for myself, man

(Verse 1)
[Tha AADity]
Trying not to fall victim to my temptation
I can keep my patience
Got me tripping on myself like Laces, Vacation
Know that that's anxiety
Know that I do not need you to ride with me

But I'd like to be
And if you are down
You get to hyping me up
You can let me know if I'm to hype for thee
I like to swim in your love, I'm a Pisces
I like when you're around, it's like you got a vice on me

[LgDaGawd]
Am I something?
Or am I nothing to you
Why has god left me with nothing to do?
Stuck with this pain and a Love struck for you
A stab in the hеart just to show me the truth

[Tha AADity]
Would you
Help mе find what's missing
Would you
Could you
Runawaywithme and break the system
Is it only superstition
Seeing signs
Yêu and I all up in my visions Premonitions
[LgDaGawd]
And I'm wishing for this love
And I'm staring at the hurt
And I know it takes time, but I'm gonna put in work
I wanna love to reach the sky
Like it's gonna leave earth
I'm tryna be that guy
But just show me what I'm worth

I don't know
I don't know I don't know I don't know
If you really do love, let it show
And when I'm on the road, let me go
Let me go Let me go Let me go

I don't know
I don't know I don't know I don't know
If you really do love, let it show
And when I'm on the road, let me go
Let me go Let me go Let me go

Vaquero,country,Aaron Watson,2017,3269,{},"[Verse 1]
This old Mexican cowboy at the bar
Looked a hundred years old
He had a million dollar smile
And his withered brown skin shimmered like California gold
He said, ""I'm a little short on cash, but I'm long on life""
""For a shot of tequila, I'll give you some dang good advice""

[Chorus 1]
He said, ""Don't leave your beer in the hot Texas sun""
""Don't argue with a woman while she's holding a gun""
""Never cheat when it comes to love or dominoes""
""Vaya con dios"" said the old vaquero

[Verse 2]
Well my heart sank
The more he drank, the more he poured out his misery
How he lost her after forty seven years
And his tears started flowing like the Rio Grand-e
He started speaking in Spanish then he kissed his rosary
Said ""Por siempre mi amor"", his one more to her memory
[Chorus 2]
He said, ""Don't live you life like a sad country song""
""A fool on a stool is still a stool, right or wrong""
""Pride is a bandito breaking hearts as he goes""
""Vaya con dios"" said the old vaquero

[Verse 3]
I walked over to the corner, turned the old jukebox on
When I turned back around like a ghost he was gone
So I paid his tab, called a cab, called it a night
And came straight home to you
As we laid there in bed I told you all the things he said
We laughed, we cried, and I held you the whole night through
You know I think of him often, out there all alone
Maybe he was an angel, or just an old man from San Anton

[Chorus 1]
He said, ""Don't leave your beer in the hot Texas sun""
""Don't argue with a woman while she's holding a gun""
""Never cheat when it comes to love or dominoes""
""Vaya con dios""

[Chorus 2]
He said, ""Don't live you life like a sad country song""
""A fool on a stool is still a stool, right or wrong""
""Pride is a bandito breaking hearts as he goes""

Forever Young,rap,Krazy Krew,2011,184,{},"[Verse 1: White Wolf]
Yeah I'm living life like I'm never gonna die
Make the most of time yeah feel like I'm always high
Way up in the sky, higher than a kite
Take off in flight and the top is in my sight
These years I've had such a great ride
Blessed with skills, love and a flow like a tide
Catch me on the beach that's where I reside
I'm gold like sand, above my troubles I glide
When I was young, miss a tooth in my smile
Now the tooth fairy's gone, gone for a while
Miss the innocence of when I was a child
When a glass of coke and chocolate made me feel wild
Never worried about money beef or crime
And I've stayed drug free all this time
Think back to the days when I thought girls were slime
I crack a smile, life is damn fine I'm

[Verse 2: Big Bear]
In this life that we reside we flow just like a tide
'Magination on our side, on toy bikes that we ride
Is where we feel most free and wherever we may be
By the sea or in a tree house
Remember when school was the place that we created
The things we couldn't have, our minds were what shaped it
And now our creations are in the form of songs
And although there's nothing wrong I really do long
For all the things I used to have, it just makes me sad
That in a few years I can buy beers
But I'll have to wave goodnight to what was in my sight
Goodbye to the trike, matchbox and the kite
Honestly I feel that in the scale of life
I'm not all that old I'm doing just fine
I've got a long time before I reach the peak
So let's go on thinking that we'll be
[Verse 3: White Wolf and Big Bear]
Now we getting old, yeah we growing up
Krazy Krew's White Wolf I used to be a cub
Rolling on my own now I've got a wolf pack
Love you boys to death yeah I've always got your back
At the age of 16 all's not said and done
It's not over 'til the fat lady has sung
Many years left hopefully filled with fun
Close my eyes, reminisce, I'm forever young

Life is growing big now but it's not a heavy pack
Life let's us be huge, not weighing on our backs
The future looks bright, get my feet of the ground
And maybe I'll sprout some wings in this game I've found
Endless opportunities stretch before my feet
Ain't I so lucky I've been born free
There's a lot of kids with much harder lives than me
And although it's so hard I wish they too can be

Tunnel Vision,rap,Faith Child,2020,45,{},"Man I love the way I'm living (No lie)
The world trying to sway my decision (Oh my)
It's cool, I ain't one to give in (Alright, why?)
'Cause I've got that tunnel vision
Cause I've got that tunnel vision
(Alright, why)
Cause I've got that tunnel vision
I'm about to go ham
What's that? Holy As Mary (whoop)
Take me off that pedestal
Please don't cheer me
I've only gone so far
'Cause God is near me
And he's Emmanuel, it's automatic, he hears me
I've never counted a milli
My bank account isn't empty
I'm grateful my daddy blessed me
Bragging it ain't my tеtly
Rapping it on your telly
Rapping a wan na sent me
It's likе a Christmas drop the way the enemy wants to tempt me
So I die to the flesh, spirit can ride till the test
And the judge will overrule, he will rise to the test
Uh, it's far from easy, it gets me feeling hopeless
But God is superman when I'm feeling lowest
He rose to the grave is breathing
Show me the way he's leading
Broke and my chains' got freedom
There's hope for they that start seeking
Protocol and the streets aren't even
God draw me away from Eden
But now I died to Adam everything is E-ven
Man I love the way I'm living (No lie)
The world trying to sway my decision (Oh my)
It's cool, I ain't one to give in (Alright, why?)
'Cause I've got that tunnel vision
Cause I've got that tunnel vision
(Alright, why?)
Cause I've got that tunnel vision
Now they wanna pout
I just kept my light lit
So they wanna take me out
For doing the Lord's biz
I got my hand on the plough
I will never forfeit
Like two couples working out, work it out
Heaven is my home
I'm suting this on UK
Never walk alone
But you know I've got that new spray
God is on the throne
Set me free, man this grooce's great
Based on a true story
Call me loose chains
Shinning in the dark
I'm a bright diamond
Im-a walk around the church
And a light's tra'lling
I'm walking this road to glorify him
Now my barber's born again
My hairline won't be backsliding
Ah, and a mic lit desk like
'Cause they ain't used to music of this type
But I still make a man more
God will take a brother from a gutter
To make a man whole
Man I love the way I'm living (No lie)
The world trying to sway my decision (Oh my)
It's cool, I ain't one to give in (Alright, why?)
'Cause I've got that tunnel vision
Cause I've got that tunnel vision
(Alright, why?)
Cause I've got that tunnel vision
Nevermind that it's paramount that I'm bearing out of my soul
The paradigm that I'm airing out when I k'everybody let's go
All the parents ought to feel
Paralysed, but I'm appearing now so I known
Got a pair of goggles I'm peering out of or the fair revising, my goal
Is, give them all something to eat (yo something to eat)
Feed them life, bon appetite (bon appetite)
'Cause we gone live forever maaan (we gon' live forever)
The only thing that's guaranteed
This right here's that good life (yeah)
We don't care what they say (we don't care)
Man I got a good wife (yeah)
Marriagee feels like a vacay (feel like vacay)
Jesus is the boss man (yes)
Here he comes so make way (make way)
I am on his good side
Others be like mayday, mayday, mayday, (be like)
Others be like mayday
This right here is black and white
I ain't gotta deal with a shade of grey
What I gotta do from day to day
I need to get my name on the database
So I gotta live in a better way
All the world will fade away, let's go
Ah, Man, I love the way I'm living (No lie)
The world trying to sway my decision (Oh my)
It's cool, I ain't one to give in (oh why, why?)

Days I Enjoy,misc,Vita Sackville-West,2016,11,{},"Days I enjoy are days when nothing happens,
When I have no engagements written on my block,
When no one comes to disturb my inward peace,
When no one comes to take me away from myself
And turn me into a patchwork, a jig-saw puzzle,
A broken mirror that once gave a whole reflection,
Being so contrived that it takes too long a time
To get myself back to myself when they have gone.
The years are too strickly measured, and life too short
For me to afford such bits of myself to my friends.
And what have I to give my friends in the last resort?
An awkwardness, a shyness, and a scrap,
No thing that's truly me, a bootless waste,
A waste of myself and them, for my life is mine
And theirs presumably theirs, and cannot touch.",2895171,en,en,en,days i enjoy are days when nothing happens when i have no engagements written on my block when no one comes to disturb my inward peace when no one comes to take me away from myself and turn me into a patchwork a jigsaw puzzle a broken mirror that once gave a whole reflection being so contrived that it takes too long a time to get myself back to myself when they have gone the years are too strickly measured and life too short for me to afford such bits of myself to my friends and what have i to give my friends in the last resort an awkwardness a shyness and a scrap no thing thats truly me a bootless waste a waste of myself and them for my life is mine and theirs presumably theirs and cannot touch,days enjoy days nothing happens engagements written block one comes disturb inward peace one comes take away turn patchwork jigsaw puzzle broken mirror gave whole reflection contrived takes long time get back gone years strickly measured life short afford bits friends give friends last resort awkwardness shyness scrap thing thats truly bootless waste waste life mine presumably touch,Negative,-0.075,0.2816666666666666

I came straight out the struggle
I been through the rain and the pain and the mud

The Ballad of Timothy Beggs,pop,Colin Buchanan,1993,213,{},"[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I'll tell you the ballad of Timothy Beggs
No antennae and hairy legs
A couple of fangs and poison glands
And a negative attitude

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Tim left home, hit a very low ebb
Off to make a life beyond the web
His mummy ate his daddy, their love went wrong
So who could Timothy trust?

[Chorus]
You can't guide a spider out of trouble
If he won't listen to you
He'll soon find himself on the wrong side
Of the stomping foot or insecticide
[Verse 3]
Tim hit skids with arachnid kids
Hangin' out in cupboards and saucepan lids
Scaring the humans out of their wits
By trying to act real cool

[Chorus]
You can't guide a spider out of trouble
If he won't listen to you
He'll soon find himself on the wrong side
Of the stomping foot or insecticide

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Timothy Beggs met his doom
Crushed by a thong in a dark bathroom
Crushing his thorax and abdomen
Spreading green and yellow goo

[Chorus]
You can't guide a spider out of trouble
If he won't listen to you
He'll soon find himself on the wrong side
Of the stomping foot or insecticide
You can't guide a spider out of trouble
If he won't listen to you
He'll soon find himself on the wrong side
Of the stomping foot or insecticide (Hisssss)

Grab my look like a crocodile

Spitting hate my way, super vile

Choose A Path,misc,Gabey Baby,2016,9,{},"There are two people who come from the same back ground and coincidence, their names are both Wes Moore. You can tell that both Wes Moores have a troubling environment surrounding them. Although both Wes Moores come from the same background, they both head down two completely different paths of one another. The overall central difference between the two Wes Moores is a fixed and growth mindset which is a concept from Brainology. The author Wes is the one with a growth mindset, which basically means he won’t settle for anything less than what he can achieve. He is from an area where it is meant for him to fail in life, but he doesn’t allow that to stop him from achieving great things in his life. Wes goes through some rough choices that allowed him to realize he needs to change. Wes started hanging around the wrong people and letting them effect some bad choices to be made. Eventually his mother had enough and didn’t want to see her boy go in the wrong direction so she sent him away to military school, it was a rude awakening for Wes, but it paid off in the long run. The other Wes has a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset is where you allow people or things to tell you who you are going to be or who you are. He is from the same area as the Author Wes, but he allows the situation to choose who he is going to be instead of him deciding and working to change that himself. He had anger issues and let it get to him over little things like trying to stab a kid for punching him over a football game. His environment definitely influenced altercations like this. His neighborhood wasn’t the best because of what people lived there and what their actions spoke of. Wes followed in his brother, Tony’s, footsteps. Wes began to sell drugs because he wanted new things and had a kid at a young age. Both of the Moores ended up in such different places in life because they separately decided on who they wanted to become with a fixed mindset for one and a growth mindset for the other.

The Author Wes Moore is a confused child still learning what’s right and wrong. He doesn’t understand what death is, so at the end of chapter one, “Is Daddy Coming with Us?” when he looks into the casket of his dead father, he thinks he is asleep and wondering when his dad is going to wake up. After the death of Westly, Wes’s grandparents offered to move Joy and her kids in with them to help provide and nurture them. Once they moved to the Bronx, Wes played basketball with kids bigger and better than him, but he didn’t let that intimidate him, so he stayed and made new friends. Wes started making some bad decisions, but before it could go any worse, his mother sent him away to military school and allowed Wes to clean up his act. Of course Wes wasn’t okay with it at first and tried to run away. He talked to his mom and she made him realize it is what’s best for him.

The other Wes Moore grew up without a father as well. He has a brother who is 6 years older than him, Tony, who is a well-known drug dealer in Baltimore. Even though Tony doesn’t do the right things, he wants his brother to not be like him and be successful. Wes and his mother live in a rather harsh area. He has 2 friends he hangs out with, Woody and White Boy. Wes gets into some trouble being rough during a football game which lead to him getting punched in the face splitting his lip open by a kid on the other team. Once that happened he remembered what his brother said, “send a message.” So they won’t ever think about doing something like that again, so he ran into the house, grabbed a knife, and went to go send a message. He ended up trying to send the message in front of cops who took him to jail before being released hours later by his brother Tony and Tony’s Father. The other Wes had a shot to not follow in his brother’s footsteps, but allowed the situation to take him there.

A big factor to separate the Moores, was that the author Wes had a lot of support from his family, and the other Wes didn’t have any at all. It is a big difference having people support you in life to them not. The other Wes could have turned out to be a great person, but didn’t have the support and motivation to do so. Author Wes is lucky he had the people to motivate him like they did because otherwise, how would he have turned out to be?

Charles Duhigg writes in The Power of Habit about the cue-routine-reward process. This would relate to author Wes by Cue, realizing away at military school he needs to get right. Routine, every day they would be set on a routine to do at the school. Reward, his mother and himself were rewarded with an improved human being. His mother wanted the bet for her son as well as their family, so they went through a lot to get him to that school. Pays out, it was worth it. His growth mindset allowed him to set high goals for him to achieve because of the support he got and him deciding for himself, he can achieve more. The other Wes, the Cue-Routine-Reward process didn’t benefit him. Wes would say it did because of the money he was making, but the way he made his money wasn’t good at all. Cue would be his customers. The routine would be him making his sells (drugs). Reward would of course be the money. He is so set on settling for less and choosing the easy way out because it’s easier on him to do this, then actually get a job. His fixed mindset allows him to make the easy way out choices and drop out of school just in the 9th grade.

The Outliers had 10,000 hours as a relationship with The Other Wes Moore. The author Wes probably spent over 10,000 hours at the military school, that helped him practice his better ways. His growth mindset allowed him to buckle down and do what he had to do to achieve his goals.  The other Wes Moore had spent at least 10,000 hours selling drugs throughout his life. Since he did it for so long and got good at it, his mindset was set on it. Why stop? He was bringing in good money and it was second nature to him so his fixed mindset allowed him to be stuck on selling drugs. The 10,000 hour relationship is where you spend that amount of time at one thing to master or perfect what you’re doing.

Brainology is the best thing to compare to both Wes Moores on why they became so different from one another. Mindset relates to habit as well because depending on what mindset you have; you choose whether to break that habit or not. Other people can help you, but it’s your choice to listen and do it. Brainology states that a fixed mindset is something already set in place and you won’t allow yourself to change it because the structure in your brain. A growth mindset allows you to grow in life and you’re in command unlike a fixed mindset. The Moores both started at the same place but ended up in two completely opposite paths because of their mindset which is such a shame because if only the Other Wes wouldn’t have allowed his background life choose his path who knows if he could have turned out to be someone great? The author Wes is an inspiration to me because just like him, I have and still am growing up in a terrible environment family and location wise. As well as he did, I am not letting that affect me, and I am choosing my own path.",2475143,en,en,en,there are two people who come from the same back ground and coincidence their names are both wes

Yeah, haha
Feels so good..
Feels so good..
Yo, check it

[Verse 1] Skits Vicious
Everyday I got a choice to make
I got a joint to blaze so
I think I'll start the morning with a wake & bake
Skitz V ain't a slave so I take a break
And watch as people go to work in the strangest space
Take a whip-it with my mate and feel my brain delay
It's been at least 2 hours since we ate the cake
Now, some turn lame and need a change of pace
In that case, I hate to say I'll stay this way (Tell 'em, son)
I let a blue pill dilate my left eye
Only when I get high
Yea, that's the next night
And when the atmosphere's just right
I got the overseas shit
That's globally the Best Buy
(Girl you look fly in the state that I'm fucking you)
Don't ask twice, yo
Sure, we taking another shoot
'Cause..
The night is young
So are we
So before it's through
Acid, pot, or pills
Is what we're gonna do
[Hook:Skits Vicious]
(Acid, pot, or pills)
So much things that we may choose
(Acid pot or pills)
Don't matter what choice we make
You know we ain't nothing to lose
(Acid, pot, or pills)
So many different things to try
So much that we may choose
(Acid, pot, or pills)
Don't matter what choice we make
You know we ain't nothing to lose

[Verse 2] Dopey Rotten
So where to go?
And what to take?
It's all off the record
No diggin' no crates
I'm gonna cut the grass so I can see the snakes
Me and my crew here to clean the slates
Take a handful of pills
Go see Brazil
Maybe take acid
And visit Lake Placid
So much things to try before I'm in my casket
D.O.P.E
Peep the way this was crafted
Roll with me if you wanna know who dope is
Roll with the duo and you'll know where the show is
Girl hit this and come fly with me
I control this, XB 360
I never come down
I like being airborne
See it all differently and feel reborn
Elevate your mind when you bump this song
(Acid, pot, or pills)
That's what we on
[Hook]

[Verse 3] Jay Reaper
Well let me choose then
I think I'll take acid later when I'm cruising
Now I pop a little x and start soothing
Relax and coolin'
Then Jimi Hendrix came through the door and started grooving
Roll up the hashish, performin' rap magic
Then fuck the redhead from the movie Roger Rabbit
(Drugs are my habit)
Gimmie the pills, gimmie the acid
Let me have it, feel fantastic
Anything you need I got that shit in my pocket
I'll take you to another planet, mind skyrocket
I'm way too high, normally known as the cool guy
But now when I'm sniffing lines look like shoe-ties
I'm not too wise
And when I say ""Drugs are bad""
Yea I do lie
My whole crew lie
Matter of fact the whole world is poppin' the pills
Light a fat one and pass it to capitol hill

Let's start a few fatal fires (Ha)
Shoot a old lady up at Meijer's (Ha)
Pull out a few vital wires (Ha)
Trust the lies of some evil liars (Hey)
The tick tock in your clock retires (Ha)
Hit rocks quick pop all tires (Ha)
Lies bullshit kicks expires (Ha)
Hittin' licks on my sick desires (Hey)

Stack forty more (Skyscraper)
Soar towards the floor to die (I wait to die)
When he finally hit, he splatters
That splish splash splat, the baddest
I'ma be the gladdest, not for the status or cheddar
All that matters is that it's fun
Forty-eight gallon drum sealed
Full of piss and chemicals from in the body parts
Stored a decade, unsealed cracked and poured
[?]
Three fifty-six a bald head tattered up
Pit bull face locked in shackles
And all that held up by two sugar sweet
Soft bony tenderoni baby ankles? What?
I [?] bony hoes though 'cause they funny as fuck
And funny as fuck is fun
You keep up with them cool sheep
And I'll keep creepin' the deep with the freakiest under the sun
Headbuttin' hoes nose bones up they own butthole
And gone with some gross shit fun
My prognosis? That shit is blown
Grown beyond some gross shit, atrocious, son

Fat stank could never be fun (No)
Fat stank ain't fun even if you think
Fat hooker stank means fat fun (No)
Fun is a crooked cop's corpse
With an open eye drained of all his blood
Fun is a bigot hottie chained by the foot
Draggin' through the rocky mud
Fun is a chomo's whole cranium
Bein' slowly yoked right off his fuckin' neck
A year after his nuts are frozen
And broken off his dick
Static with a lip flap, really buddy?
I'm so dramatic and your shit flaps, silly putty
Let me bring that fun back, [?]
Zoom with the boom with the red moon rap
Somethin' nutty like classical songs
I love jumpin' through tones and notes, what a nice swerve
Make me kinda wanna hijack a sold-out cruise ship
And play bumper boats with the icebergs
Tell the crew I'm new, fuck rules legit
Only rule for me is be cool as shit
And we doin' tricks, like speedin' up quick
Dip the tip in so this bitch flip
I'm everybody buddy, captain bubbly
I [?], so fuck the dougie
The whole shit trippin', underwater dippin'
[Your daughter ?] clown drippin' on me and I'm huntin' chickens

Drodgy cooked that shit, yuh

[Hook]
You know that I'm cooking shit I'm making beats all day
Wanna take a shot to be an emcee, writing shit since May
Others wanna follow my footsteps, I will not lay, no
Carpet down for you bitches, so you gon have to pray
If you wanna work with me, why don't you hit me up
So, you can come over and start to fill another cup
Grafic gon take your bitch right from you, don't gotta jump
I'mma make sure you got red dots on your face, look like a bump

[Verse 1]
Ay yah, that shit look like bump
When you get a fucking bump, I'm guessing you a chump
If you be a chump, then I guess I gotta dump, you
Grafic gonna fuck your hoe, hit her with a hump, yeah
If you gonna fuck around then go and fuck your bitch
Do not go around the town and suck right on the dick
If you do, then do it with your little dick clique
Meet up, I'mma hit you with my little spartakick
100 on my wrist, 80 on my wrist
Bitch, I am not like that I'mma go and take my distance
I'm not tryna go for that shit in this instance
Come after me, I'mma turn you into cooked minced meat
Do not underestimate my flow, it is on beat
Whenever I spit, I attempt the large feats
Running laps around you like I'm at a track meet
Let me teach you a lesson, go ahead and take a seat

Our altercation will settle your fucking fate
Bitch I will not play around with your fish bait
You can feel my wrath but you will never feel my hate
Closed off all the doors, bitch I closed your only gate
Yeah bitch I am growing, you know that I'm gaining height
Come on over closer, bitch I do not ever bite
You fuck with my clique, then I guess that I gotta fight
Catching hands with me will not be like flying a kite
Running all day, I'm chasing for the mil
At this point, all I want is hundred dollar bills
I'm not gonna take the ghetto way, go and kill
I got hella dreams man, what's your fucking deal
I may have always gotten my meals right when I wanted it
But I have been shot down by some people, bitch I have been hit
I'm not gonna get myself in trouble, won't be hitting licks
People wanna know why I do this, mainly just for kicks

The Dutchman,pop,Josh White Jr.,2015,23,{},"The Dutchman is not the kind of man
To keep his thumb jammed in a dam that holds his dreams in
But that's a secret only Margaret knows
When Amsterdam is golden
In the morning Margaret brings him breakfast. She believes him
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow
He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes

Chorus:
Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee
Long a-go, I used to be a young man
Now dear Margaret re-members that for me
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes
His hat and coat are patched with the love that Margaret sewed him
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam
He watches tugboats down canals
And calls out to them when he thinks he knows the captain
'til Margaret comes to take him home again
Through unforgiving streets that trip him though he holds her arm
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone and calls her name
Chorus
The windmills whirl the winter wind
She winds his muffler tighter
They sit in the kitchen
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew
He sees her for a moment
He calls her name out
She makes the bed up, humming some old love song
She learned the tune when it was very new
He hums a line or two
They hum together in the dark
The Dutchman falls asleep & Margaret blows the candle out

Im Going to Hell,rap,Esau,2011,405,{},"I feel no peer pressure.  If I lived in Cali
Between Blood and Crip blocks I'd be a cross dresser, I'm the man
If i stood up and started rhyming in church
I'd have the whole congregation saying Goddamn - that kid's nice
Forget the offering plate pass around the liquor and dice
Up in this piece word to Jesus
Word life I'm wild - Honestly honesty's my style
'Cause I tell jokes about handicapped kids and don't even smile
Yah, dah, du get on the short bus
Cause you holding up the perfect ones of us, hush
Watch your mouth, motherfucker please
Unlike you I cheered for clinton out loud
When he had Monica on her knees
I know it's fucked up and not nice, but it's my mouth
And i'm the one that's going to have to pay the price
For saying all these things out loud and not keeping them to myself
And if that's the price then damn right i'm going to hell

CHORUS
I'm going to hell son, take my soul and set it free below
Got me flexing on the world tell it where I'm about to go
I'm going to hell, quick for sure you know, see me on the top
Even if I'm on the bottom still my body's gonna rock
I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell
The debut be the farewell too - for who
Esau bring the evil out of you - me too
Esau to burn in hell yo
I once met Jesus in a mosque, right after I talked to Allah
We was in a synagogue, with Buddah and Vishnu
They said damn right you going to hell, what'd you expect
You've offended everyone and everything you've ever met
I'm sorry, i'm an honest guy
I've said everything you were scared to say
And I've tried everything you were scared to try
I don't play people like they're some kind of game
And I got balls enough to treat everyone the same
I once told Stevie Wonder to watch his diet
I put ground pork in Farrakhan's falafel and told him to try it
I yelled out oj is innocent, but he killed that bitch
And started a riot
And I gave marion barry a piece of crack and told him to light it
I once paid a hooker dwarf to go up on me
I gave Tonya the idea to bust Nancy in the knee
I got mad at my grandma and knocked out her false teeth
And Sammy Davis once told me he had his eye on me
At times I feel all dirty like I just raped myself
I'm such an asshole that I can't even respect myself
And I guess that's why I'm all by myself
And when they lock me away in prison for life
I won't even touch myself
I feel like you don't be understanding me
Because I'm not a disciple of your hypochristianity
Every day when I turn on the TV
I see Robert Tilton doing his best to convert me
Or take money from me to build up his so called ministry
As a christian do you prove your faith financially
Can poor people go to heaven, if so how about me?
And why haven't I ever seen a TV muslim missionary
I'll be judged on earh by you and then i'll be punished in hell
For not being mislead and being myself
Of all my faults I'm well aware and listen
I can even drop 5% knowledge in your ear
You say i'm going to hell, it well I'm already here

Oh baby
My babyface
Maintain kayfabe or
We don't get paid
These days our vacant space
Escapes us
I ain’t got no guarantee
I ain't got the heart to take a bump
So instead I took three
Off a key and dealt with
That irregular thump
Palpitations
Made in the USA
Approved by the food and drug
Administration
Twice a day
When you wake up
When you fade
When you labor
When you play
When you ruminate
On who they've made
A heel or a face
Yeah they say
Idle hands do devil’s work
Not construct or create
So they keep you occupied
As jobber on the take
Right and proper
Slobberknockers
They can break a man in two
Good god almighty
Don't stop fighting
For contracts and new boots
I don't think about it
Baby please just hit me clean
I'm so ‘bout it, ‘bout it
Give ‘em what they paid to see
I don't think about it
Collect my check every week
And tell ‘em please
Hit me hit me hit me hit me

Crash crash crash the pose
Have a cat nap in your clothes
Grab a snack and get back in your zone
You dont ever need to go home
Cause at home you just pick up the phone
You're so lonely but you're never on your own
So take your licks
And see what sticks
And if you can't get over
Kick the habit
In your hotel bed, alone
Feeling less and less like yourself
A life that’s not your own
You’re a bit more like a clone
Yeah a bit more like a clown
Pattern down
Repeat until loser leaves town
I don't think about it
Baby please just hit me clean
I’m so ‘bout it, ‘bout it
Give ‘em what they paid to see
I don't think about it
Collect my check every week
And tell ‘em please
Hit me hit me hit me hit me

Well I've been sequestered down in Texas
Attempting to address all these questions
I've been Wrestling with guessing
Which beds you’ve slept in
Your most recent nights of passion
Oh, I'm so enlightened tell myself
You're a sweetheart
So I keep part
Of the best parts
Of our thing
But actually I'd really rather
Not step back in the ring
Ill cut good promos
I'll work the mic
Stick to the script
Say all the right things
So I don't mean this out of spite but
I hope you've found all the makings
Of a much more interesting life
Experiential tourism
Is at its all-time height
And I swear I'm not being
Overly dramatic when I say
If you use the word wanderlust
I'll take a razorblade straight to my face
And wrap
Barbed wire 'round my fucking eyes
Cause I've seen through this
Plate glass Window Before
It got cracked over my dome
I got no tricks up my sleeve

Sour Milk Song,misc,The Jane Austen Argument,2012,220,{},"When I woke up
This morning
I said 'no more sad love songs'
So I made a cup of tea
But the fucking milk was sour
And lumpy
So I threw it against the wall
And traced its drooping? trajectory
And said now, you can just sing sour stories

Like you say
This is what you wanted
What you wanted
And you'll say this is life, this is life, this is life, this is life
What good is a heart that can't be bruised?
But I'm not a paper cup to be thrown away once I've been used.

And I know I know I know
That it's all in mind
But that doesn't explain the mess I've made scrubbing the wall with lemon rind
Oooh and you know you know you know
That there's no use crying now
It's something your mother once said
That you've only just figured out.
And you say
This is what you wanted
What you wanted
And you'll say this is life, this is life, this is life, this
What good is a heart that can't be bruised?
But I'm not a paper cup to be thrown away, oh, after you're through

And you won't believe me
When I say
You've been outdone
That a new way to love is a new way to hurt someone

And I won't believe me
When you say I've had my fun
Because even the days I don't lose and the nights I never feel that I've won

When I say
This is what I wanted
What I wanted
And I'll say this is life, this is life this is life, this is life.

Meaning, I was fiddling willing to compromise to get a listen in
But screw it, where's the fun in worrying bout how I fit the trend?

Hi, you there, Mr. Dreamer, you’re entwined, my darling, darling
Hey, for good or bad, there’s going to be a melody of rain tonight
Hi, you there, Mr. Dreamer, you stumble, my darling, darling
Hey, are you going to waver in the rain all sealed into the past?

Now, goodbye to your unsatisfactory life! I will accompany you, who are quivering alone in the rain
You’re so fed up in your mind. Clad in ragged clothes, you’re empty today too
Let’s dance without caring about anyone!

This is Ghost Alley; you may pass
Without even knowing love, you haven’t yet found
The hollow that no one can see
Amid the rain of originality, the lost soul
Is drowning in love and heading for the future

Well, it’s not like there’s salvation, though

It’s my turn to prove that I’m great/ by choosing my fate, I will not be abused by dismay
And since I’m a rapper I guess I’ll wrap (rap) up this whole game till no rapper can ventilate
Groupie hoes get penetrate/ they wear lingerie
She made sure that French was her lace/ An I’m not T.I
But they’ll do anything for the Band man (‘rubber band man’) I was just playing the bass
I was displaying a chase, after this paper / In God We Trust
But the bank run by Satan/ Yeezy thought he need Nia Long dog I’m more Sanaa Lathan
I need a bad redbone for me to ball with/ Shopping sprees we be Spaulding
Copping trees/ cuz I know La (NOLA) , like New Orleans
Mardi Gras/ Get your party on with these bosses
I wonder how outsiders perceive my city/ Is it the mecca of making it in America?
I once was American dreaming/ Til’ Uncle Sam got up and pinched me
Told me I’ve always been gifted/Santa Clause never existed
But really there’s Grinch’s that’s stealing our freedom/just to give it back in disguise of good deeds
You can’t see through that act? / them tinted windows you can’t see through that Ac (Acura)?
Automatics get squeezed/ then I read through somebody’s news feed that you passed
Snakes will be the first to lead you to your grave/ So I suggest that you please cut your grass
Could of sworn I head somebody utter: Freedom at Last
Sample from Martin Luther King: ‘I Have a Dream Speech’ playing

Verse 2:

It’s my turn to prove that I’m great/ and I will not fail my destiny just been delayed
Surrounded by death and decay/ Demonic malevolent ways of the powers be
That’s why I’m killing all kings / and taking their power and tossing it right in the mouth of the streets
My niggas gotta eat, Y’all niggas gotta feast/ You Can’t afford to share
We can’t afford them shares at Stock Market/ Let alone insurance at the Doc’s office
If I get shot I gotta brush that off did it for my dogs in them locked coffins/ already underground
Been the illest nigga in the underground/ Not just lyrical but they love my sound
Told my ex girl, that my next girl, be the reason she feel like a fucking clown
Knew better then you do better/ damn that pussy tight and she screw better
Bank account got old money/ New cheddar

Moving On,pop,Trace Cyrus,2019,17,{},"Love isn't fair

In the nighttime
It's the only time we feel alive
We're hungover in the day
On the bright side
She's calling me the right guy
But I don't know if I can stay

I'm not looking for a lover
I always find another
There's girls everywhere
Things got so bad with Brenda
Flowers I would send her
But she didn't care

I'm moving on
I can't stay the night
When the feeling is right
Then maybe I'll slow down
I'm moving on
The diamond ring didn't last
Now it's all in the past
And she's feeling lost now
I had a couple secrets lovers
And we had under covers
But we didn't sleep
Some names I can't remember
Fall in love but can't surrender
I can't get too deep

I'm not looking for a lover
I always find another
There's girls everywhere
Things got so bad with Stacey
I guess she kinda played me
But love isn't fair

I'm moving on
I can't stay the night
When the feeling is right
Then maybe I'll slow down
I'm moving on
The diamond ring didn't last
Now it's all in the past
And she's feeling lost now

When I get high well it all feels make believe
Drop dead gorgeous but I always seem to leave
I got a problem when I feel they hold me down
Love's a gamble but I'll another round
If she got curves and she swerves like a Benz
Then we could a night we wouldn't forget
Say you want it we'll have bottles all around
But in the morning I'll be cruising out of town

I'm moving on
I can't stay the night
When the feeling is right
Then maybe I'll slow down
I'm moving on
The diamond ring didn't last
Now it's all in the past
And she's feeling lost now

This is War 3: Shadow Isles vs The Void,rap,Falconshield,2014,79998,"{Keyori,AntiRivet,""Nicki Taylor"",Blakinola,Rawb09,""Roberto D\\'Alessandro""}","[Verse 1: Blakinola (Hecarim)]
Embrace the Isle's Wrath, I am on the warpath
A mix of pain and desolation's on the forecast
Four-legged apparition stomping out the opposition
I'm on a mission bringin real life to superstition
Spectral riders at my side as I gain speed
You're guaranteed to quiver in your boots when I stampede
A blue ribbon for my shadows when they're on the onslaught
Your suffering is magic to my eyes when you get caught
Let's accelerate the process get a Need for Speed
I'm too Fast & Furious to ever lose the lead
The ground I run upon turns lifeless as it decomposes
I'll split your soul like parting water, call me shadow moses
I depart from this battleground torn by violence
The crack of brittle bones fills the air, breaking silence
Do yourself a favor, let me tell you how to win your trials
Bow down to the dark steed from the Shadow Isles

[Verse 2: Nicki Taylor (Elise)]
I'm on course, what a tangled web I weave
Come forth and take a bow, kneel before the spider queen
The beautiful arachnid whom you worship when you see me walk in
Testing all the boundaries like GLaDOS with my neurotoxin
It's such a shame when you flee and I give chase
You know death can only kill you, stop denying my embrace
The soothe of my voice, leaving you attracted
Echoes in your head, I'm radioactive
Into your cerebellum, I will inject my venom
My carnage reigns chaotic, perfect and symbiotic
The lights are dimming, veins are pulsing and your heart is failing
Throat is swelling, eyes are bleeding, organ tissue ailing
You're twitching on the ground, feeling your flesh decay
My spider emissaries, they take your husk away
I dig inside you, drink your blood with such virility
With great power comes great possibilities
[Chorus: Falconshield]
Cower in fear
Cover your eyes
Go to that place
Where you feel safe
Trust in the lies
Tell yourself you'll be fine
But you can't deny...

[Verse 3: Rawb09 (Kha'Zix)]
I hit 6 and I transform like the Megazord
Consume and adapt and I'm getting used to this smorgasbord
Fullmetal and I ain't talking about alchemy
The Wings come out now I'm wing zero out of Gundam Wing
Jump like springs, dunk and I rebound to be branded like I'm Michael Jordan; MVP
Don't need to diss Trick2g just to perform a trick shot
I'll hit R and pop up in bot lane like a Shaco Box
Hop like scotch with no liquor involved
Pimp like the dog, metal claws like scyther trade and I'm set to evolve
I'll let the cat out of the bodybag, I mean Rengar
Looks like your teamwork is faulty I'd advise you recall
I'm about that action you see the swagger? I have maxed it
Just honing my lethal passive lone wolfs are just target practice
Who needs some boots when I am cruisin' around in moccasins
Known for killing the meta, you can call it Metalocolypse
I'm the mantis god, I'll make you prey
Destroy the spectre that's reflected opposite of the flay
So don't portray a part, you're not far from being the hero
From the void I'll cut you in half, now that's dividin' by zero
[Verse 4: Keyori (Kog'Maw)]
Welcome to the Void, meet the mouth of the abyss
Are you here to feed me? 'Cos I'm getting quite ravenous
So gaze into the void rift, admire the view
But first you'll be toyed with, 'cos I play with my food
I'm munching, crunching on my luncheon
Dropping nukes on enemies bunching
Atomic, stomach, Acid vomit
Drop it like a bile comet
Cosset my food, like it's one of my brood
You taste salty, you from NA?
I don't mean to be rude...
I'm not your typical, critical carry serial killer
But I eat a lot of Kellog's, call me cereal killer
Til' I vomit up cornflakes, so the cereal kills ya
Say ""cheerio"" to your team, love from: The Bacterial Spiller
I'm iller than Illidan, fill the void in my stomach
Sins caused by gluttony, subtly fetch me the cutlery
And the utterly, butterly run from me
'Cos I got a thundering, hungering
So flee I suggest, 'Cos I want meat
And I smell soft flesh

[Chorus: Falconshield]
Cower in fear
Cover your eyes
Go to that place
Where you feel safe
Trust in the lies
Tell yourself you'll be fine
But you can't deny...
The chills up your spine!
[Verse 5: AntiRivet (Mordekaiser)]
(I will bring great suffering!)
Onto the field I storm, clad in a metal swarm
A living suit of armor to the battle I'm reborn
I offer you this chance, strike me if you're feeling brazen
You'll beg for mercy as you dare to Kiss my Iron Maiden
My mace is crushing bones and Sister that's a bad habit
I sacrifice your Carcass now upon this Black Sabbath
You ask from whom the bell tolls when this demon walks
Your time is running out upon this MegaDETHKlok
I run through the night, a Manowar who fights
I leave you In Flames, a Mastodon with savage might
Ministry of the dead, driving this Motörhead
Enslaved in ether, I'm a Slayer to the very end
I'm bleeding nitro, Accept your final woe
I'll drag your corpse upon the ground and call it Skidrow
You're in a world of hurt, deep in the Iced Earth
My children of the grave, I give to you this grand rebirth

[Verse 6: Falconshield (Cho'Gath)]
Make room, the terror of the void
Has come to the rift to consume and destroy
I'm a freak on steroids, smash like a freighter
A spawn from the void, call me violator
Bring your child to the Shadow Isles
A fun expedition to make them smile
Come home with me, and stay a while
I'll Cho you the meaning of being hostile
Brawlers - Nom Nom
Support - Nom Nom
Mages - Nom Nom
Junglers - Nom Nom
A sea of bodies to Supersize Me
I take the free meal, and rinse with tea
Just like Jimmy, I eat the world
Put an end to hunger? That's absurd
I grant one wish on your dying breath
Better choose wisely, cake or death

[Guitar Solo: Martin Floberg]

[Guitar Solo: Roberto D'Alessandro]

[Chorus: Falconshield]
Cower in fear
Cover your eyes
Go to that place
Where you feel safe

Read at 4:09 AM,rap,MATO,2015,23,{},"[Verse 1]
Let me speak for the ambiance in the room
I see a silhouette of a tusk prancing by the wallpapers
But elephants can't move in a prompt manner?
This one can, it's quite the prancer
I'll be looking like him if my hand keeps excavating this Pringles can
This manner is only because my ex didn't plan on having a man who is an anxious fuck
Who eats to handle self pity, to handle self pity like a marble, and stop, dropping, and rolling in your palm, my palm sparkles from sour cream particles making the marble stop in its print, pondering on the thought of licking the flesh to taste saturation, and keep me updated on how many kids I'll possess
Three at best with my imagination
It's a fucking hex to force regret, and dismiss
This miss, who broke logistics when her lipsticks whispered glistening, lists of her lust for me and my alliteration cysts
Turns out that was all scheisse
Those love letters were Cottonelle because she's a little shit
I used to marvel at her fibs like the marble clenched in my fist
But I digress (no I don't)
It is a poem where I stock the indignant thoughts and prisms of when you imprisoned me with our walks at the park
My heart was making rhythms
But I was stringent on who could tune in
Only two who car pooled and whaled on me for being stuck on you, they harpooned me and clutched my hand on the dark colored carbon microphone, and to a starry moon, we recorded a song about how no bad days are bad enough to exclude
Since then, thats the only thing I include
I need gills, the way I'm surrounded in blue
The only shrill thrill that's surreal is when a light flickers on the phone, and I see your nickname
And the details, cannot be distilled, she asks me for a plug for alcohol, ""that is not distilled""
Were her nerves bequeathed from Lucifer? The fucking way she treats me
Right there I should have sold my soul for a nice iced pale of ale for pity
But then again, I was taught to never sign a treaty
(No, don't do it!)
Then again, we never even had a stark kiss
I pursed my lips and she said, ""Sorry Charlie, my charcoal hasn't been lit""
I must've done little to preserve a friendship, but I'm not Doolittle, I don't have patients
I mean shit, I don't mean shit

Walking in Your Nightmare,rock,Vandamne,1994,53,{},"Hello
It’s me again, a vision from your past
The leading actor in the cast
In the theatre of your imagination
I’ve come to take what’s mine
Your soul, your body, and your mind

There’s nowhere to run from
All the promises you didn’t keep
You won’t escape me
Cause I will come and get you in your sleep

Now that the night has come
While you dream of other men
I will reappear again
Just when you thought it was safe to go to sleep
Just like on the silver screen
I will be right there in your dreams

Don’t be afraid
In your waking moments I won’t be around
As soon as the night falls
You know just where I can be found
I’ll be walking in your nightmare
Talking in your sleep
Walking in your nightmare
Walking in your nightmare

You won’t forget me
I’ll see to that in any way I can
Every time you close your eyes
You know I’ll be there again

Oh they say that revenge is sweet
I’m gonna make you pay
I’ll be there for real one day
So keep an eye over your shoulder
You don’t know when I’ll strike
So in the meantime

I’ll be walking in your nightmare
Talking in your sleep
Walking in your nightmare
Walking in your nightmare
Talking in your sleep
Talking in your sleep

Overnight Story,pop,John Hiatt,1982,34,{},"They took enough of my mind
To make a calculator
Addin' up the figures, they'll find
That love's a dumbwaiter

Waitin' for the dream to fade
Right into you hit parade
Maybe I've made that long black list
But I was born when we first kissed

Not another overnight story
No overnight success
We've hung around too long for glory
Is it too late for happiness?
Yesterday is over now
And we've come too far to bow

Here comes Swifty, they're off
To chase another headline
But all the news gets soft
Before it makes the deadline
The morning paper hits my door
But I don't read it any more
Yes I know what went on last night
You made your coffin before daylight

Not another overnight story
No overnight success
We've hung around too long for glory
Is it too late for happiness?
Yesterday is over now
And we've come too far to bow

They're adding inches at our expense
To the measure of their capital worth
The next big thing is gonna dance and sing
Us all off of the face of this earth

They call it big time love
But I'm not nervous
'Cause all your turtledoves
Are out of service

And all those arc lights comb the sky
For any little birds that fly
You're all still jerks, and we're still here
Fast asleep at the big premiere
Not another overnight story
No overnight success
We've hung around too long for glory
Is it too late for happiness?
Yesterday is over now
And we've come too far to bow",1722668,en,en,en,they took enough of my mind to make a calculator addin up the figures theyll find that loves a dumbwaiter waitin for the dream to fade right into you hit parade maybe ive made that long black list but i was born when we first kissed not another overnight story no overnight success weve hung around too long for glory is it too late for happiness yesterday is over now and weve come too far to bow here comes swifty theyre off to chase another headline but all the news gets soft before it makes the deadline the morning paper hits my door but i dont read it any more yes i know what went on last night you made your coffin before daylight not another overnight story no overnight success weve hung around too long for glory is it too late for happiness yesterday is over now and weve come too far to bow theyre adding inches at our expense to the measure of their capital worth the next big thing is gonna dance and sing us all off of the face of this earth they call it big time love but im not nervous cause all your turtledoves are out of service and all those arc lights comb the sky for any little birds that fly youre all still jerks and were still here fast asleep at the big premiere not another overnight story no overnight success weve hung around too long for glory is it too late for happiness yesterday is over now and weve come too far to bow,took enough mind make calculator addin figures theyll find loves dumbwaiter waitin dream fade right hit parade maybe ive made long black list born first kissed another overnight story overnight success weve hung around long glory late happiness yesterday weve come far bow comes swifty theyre chase another headline news gets soft makes deadline morning paper hits door dont read yes know went last night made coffin daylight another overnight story overnight success weve hung around long glory late happiness yesterday weve come far bow theyre adding inches expense measure capital worth next big thing gon na dance sing us face earth call big time love im nervous cause turtledoves service arc lights comb sky little birds fly youre still jerks still fast asleep big premiere another overnight story overnight success weve hung around long glory late happiness yesterday weve come far bow,Positive,0.1259858630952381,0.3891369047619047

What you gave me for free
My tail and ears is short so they can’t bite me
My eyes are perfect to see

Hey I used to whine but now I growl
And yelp to show them who I am. youknow

Say
Who do you want to catch
Now Say
Who do you want to fetch

What's wrong?
My sharp prong
The solution to give peace and silence
But hey
I can’t go ahead
Since you’re dead

This skin is getting too tight
I’m gonna rip it off
And make your mine
Now
With the darkest eyes
You can see the world
In black and white
